MAJOR FEATURES:
	*Handle plurals in units
	*Calendar for meal planning
	*Instead of saving "servings" of a recipe, change it to "yield" and allow a unit ( i.e. 5 servings, 2 dozen )
	*Command-line interface
	*Improved printing support: I'd like to allow, for example, printing on recipe cards.

CONVENIENCES/MINOR FEATURES:
	*E-mail recipe(s) option (using kapp->invokeMailer())
	*Show properties in columns
	*Select which properties to show
	*Give option to import recipe formats by pasting the recipe text into a widget
	*Allow saving and loading diet info from a file (or just store it in the database?)
	*Database maintenance options (Empty database, Remove unused elements, etc.)
	*Configurable shopping list (Maybe allow the user to select a style sheet or add a section to settings dialog... or both)

BUGS/OTHER:
	*PRIORITY: Secure database access passwords
	*The icons on the left menu at times will disappear... I can't seem to reproduce this, however
	*Make use of transactions in database backends where appropriate
	*Give a warning when deleting categories (such as when a recipe was a part of that category)
	*Don't show the empty unit in the unit page

uga:
(I don't claim ownership of these. If you do it, I'll be happy too :) )

planned for 0.8:
	*Step-by-Step recipe instructions with photos
	*Check ingredients from existing kitchen resource table? Check amounts in the ingredient matcher?
	*Add an option to popup for newly created ingredients, and include the USDA nutritional info at the same time
