MAJOR FEATURES:
	*Handle plurals in units
	*Calendar for meal planning
	*Instead of saving "servings" of a recipe, change it to "yield" and allow a unit ( i.e. 5 servings, 2 dozen )
	*Command-line interface

CONVENIENCES/MINOR FEATURES:
	*E-mail recipe(s) option (using kapp->invokeMailer())
	*Show properties in columns
	*Select which properties to show
	*Give option to import recipe formats by pasting the recipe text into a widget
	*Allow saving and loading diet info from a file (or just store it in the database?)
	*Database maintenance options (Empty database, Remove unused elements, etc.)

BUGS/OTHER:
	*Make use of transactions in database backends where appropriate
	*Give a warning when deleting categories (such as when a recipe was a part of that category)
	*Update configure scripts - MySQL is a run-time dependency and so configure doesn't deal with it.
	*Allow not compiling particular backends through 'configure'.
	*Don't show the empty unit in the unit page

uga:
(I don't claim ownership of these. If you do it, I'll be happy too :) )

planned for 0.7:
	*remote database recipe importing (multiple databases open and recipe transfer)
	
planned for 0.8:
	*Step-by-Step recipe instructions with photos
	*Check ingredients from existing kitchen resource table? Check amounts in the ingredient matcher?
	*Add an option to popup for newly created ingredients, and include the USDA nutritional info at the same time
