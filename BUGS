* Importing recipes from *.kreml files does not work with PostgreSQL backend,
  loading the examples from the setup assistant does not work for the same
  reason.

* Click Ingredient Matcher on left panel, select several random ingredients and
  click on the right arrow; some ingredients might be missing in the right
  list.

* We have lost formatting options in the preferences dialog.

* On my debian system, if I don't provide a password for PostgreSQL, krecipes
  silently fails.

* On the edit rating dialog, add a rating, then click on the stars in the list
  view, enter some number to edit the number of stars. It only works with
  integer numbers. The same on the advanced search tab.

* All importer/exporter tests are failing or giving warnings except kretest.
