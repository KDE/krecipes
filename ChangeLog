Changes from 0.8 to SVN:
  -New yield property for recipes: rather than storing the number of servings, it now stores a yield amount and type.  The amount may also be a range.
  -Backup/restore of entire database
  -Ingredient amounts can be ranges
  -Recipe lists now allow selecting multiple recipes.  For example, this is handy for exporting, viewing, or printing multiple recipes at once
  -Allows multiple preparation methods
  -PostgreSQL backend now stable

Changes from 0.7 to 0.8:
  -Redesigned advanced search: search on the "and", "or", and "not" conditions of each search term.  Can now search on nearly any item possible.
  -Reduce memory requirements for large databases.  Very large databases should now be possible, though work continues to be put into this.  It is being tested on a database with 37,000 recipes and counting.
  -Improve recipe import speeds, keeping a fairly constant speed no matter what the size of the database.

Changes from 0.6 to 0.7:
  -BETA support for PostgreSQL database backend
  -Database to database transfer (Remote or local).
  -Support for grouping ingredients.  Also imports group information from import formats, such as Meal-Master.
  -There's a new intermediate interface between displaying the shopping list and selecting recipes for it.  Here you can add, remove, or modify ingredients used in those selected recipes.
  -Load sample recipes based on locale.  If we don't currently have your locale, please submit some recipes to us!
  -Border options added to recipe display
  -Autocomplete ingredients typed in the instructions text edit
  -Updated USDA data from SR16-1 to SR17 (released September, 2004)
  -'Configure' options to disable particular backends
  -Support for drag and drop in the shopping list dialog
  -Behind the scenes, the internal structure of Krecipes has improved, quickly bringing it closer toward our 1.0 release
  -Overall, more stability, interface, and useability enhancements

Changes from 0.5 to 0.6:
  -Support for subcategories
  -Preparation time field for recipes
  -Rezkonv import filter
  -Eliminated the dependence on mysql.h (mysql-devel)
  -Advanced search which can search by ingredients, categories, authors, servings, and preparation time
  -Significant speed increases while navigating Krecipes due to the fact that reloading all data when switching dialogs is no longer necessary.
  -When renaming an element to something that already exists, merge the two into one
  -Provide popup menus to many listviews for easy access to common functions
  -Fix display of characters in certain locales (In particular, this fixes the problem many people had displaying umlauts)
  -Actually hide items in the Page Setup that aren't going to be shown in the recipe view
  -Allow renaming of unit and prep method once it is entered in the recipe input (from the list view)
  -Allow an empty or zero amount and an empty unit for ingredients
  -Set the cursor to change to the wait cursor for operations that could take more than a few seconds -- this makes the app seem more responsive
  -Fix some escape/encoding issues in the generated HTML
  -Support for SQLite 3
  -Add a Reload and Edit action to the menu
  -Accessibility improvements
