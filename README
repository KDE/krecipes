Krecipes is a Recipe Book for KDE. It requires KDE 3.1 or greater (and Qt >= 3.1, but < 4)


First of all, make sure you have at least one of the three necessary databases installed: SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL. In case you decide to use MySQL or PostgreSQL, make sure also that you have Qt's MySQL or PostgreSQL plugin properly installed. The program won't work without database support.
 
**  Building The Latest (1.0-beta2) Release
 
 Just untar the package first:
 
 tar -zxf krecipes-1.0-beta2.tar.gz
 
 And compile (see ./configure --help for more compile options like '--prefix' and '--with-qt-dir')
 
 ./configure
 make
 make install
 
 
** Downloading And Compiling Through Subversion
 
 The project is now being developed under extragear/utils in KDE's servers. 

Please notice that this application is beta, meaning everything is expected to work, but the possibility is there that some things might not.  Note that the more our users tells us about bugs, the faster we can find them and fix them.

svn co -N svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/extragear/utils krecipes-svn
