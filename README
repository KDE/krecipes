Krecipes is a Recipe Book for KDE. It requires KDE 4.4 or greater (and Qt 4).


** Dependencies

Additionally to whatever Krecipes is linked against, you will need the client
programs (i.e shell commands sqlite3, mysql ... ) for your database if you want
to use the Krecipes backup feature. If you want to use "krecipes
--convert-sqlite3" you will need both sqlite and sqlite3 shell commands.

** Build Dependencies

 If you're using an APT based GNU/Linux distribution you may want to install
 the following packages: 
  - kdelibs5-dev
  - libqimageblitz-dev 
  - libsqlite3-dev or libsqlite0-dev
  - libxml2-dev
  - libxslt1-dev
  - libqtwebkit-dev

** Building The Latest Release
 
 Just untar the package first:
 
 tar -zxf krecipes-2.x.x.tar.gz (replace x with the corresponding version number)
 
 And compile:
 
 cd krecipes-2.x.x (replace x with the corresponding version number)
 mkdir build && cd build
 cmake ..
 make
 make install
 
 
** Downloading, Building And Installing The Latest Development Version With Git
 
 The project is being developed under extragear/utils in KDE's servers. 

 To download the source code, do:
 
 git clone git://anongit.kde.org/krecipes

 To update the source code, do:

 cd krecipes
 git pull

 To build and install it in the default prefix (usually /usr/local):

 mkdir build && cd build
 cmake ..
 make
 make install

 To build and install it in other prefix, for instance ~/.kde/:

 mkdir build && cd build
 cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.kde/ 
 make
 make install

 Also if you install it in ~/.kde/ you may want to set the following variables
 in your .bashrc (or wherever it's appropiate for you):

 export PATH=~/.kde/bin:${PATH}
 export MANPATH=~/.kde/man:$(manpath)
 export KDEDIRS=~/.kde:/usr
 export XDG_DATA_DIRS=~/.kde/share:${XDG_DATA_DIRS}
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/.kde/lib

 To uninstall it:

 cd build && make uninstall


** Test programs

 Krecipes comes with some programs (targeted to testers and developers) to test
 importers and exporters. You can build it adding "-DKDE4_BUILD_TESTS=ON" when
 you execute cmake.

 You can execute all the tests just typing 'make test'. If any of them fails
 and you need to see more details about what failed, you should execute the
 failing test individually; you can do this just typing the name of the test in
 the command line, they are installed in the same place than the 'krecipes'
 executable.


** Hidden features

 There are a couple of hidden (hidden because they are not supported yet)
 features, to show it you can put these two lines:

 [Advanced]
 UnhideMergeTools=true

 in krecipesrc configuration file.

 You can see the features ("Merge Similar Categories..." and "Merge Similar
 Ingredients...") in the "Tools" menu.


** The NukeDB tool

 nukedb is a development tool to fill the Krecipes database with huge amounts
 of data. You can build it along with Krecipes adding "-DBUILD_NUKEDB=ON" when
 you execute cmake. To use it just type "nukedb" in the console.
