Changes from 0.5 to current CVS:
  -Rezkonv import filter
  -Eliminated the dependence on mysql.h (mysql-devel)
  -Significant speed increases while navigating Krecipes due to the fact that reloading all data when switching dialogs is no longer necessary.
  -Support for subcategories
  -When renaming an element to something that already exists, merge the two into one
  -Actually hide items in the Page Setup that aren't going to be shown in the recipe view
  -Allow renaming of unit and prep method once it is entered in the recipe input (from the list view)
  -Advanced search which can search by ingredients, categories, authors, and servings
  -Set the cursor to change to the wait cursor for operations that could take more than a few seconds -- this makes the app seem more responsive
  -Fix some escape/encoding issues in the generated HTML
