<listitem><para>Web page &ndash; files of this format will have extensions of .html</para>
 
<para>You might choose to export in this format in order to create a web page that contains your recipes.  However, it should be noted that once exported in Web page format, you are unable to import these recipes back into <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Meal-Master &ndash; files of this format will have extensions of .mmf and you might want to export in this format to be able to import into the Meal-Master program to share will other Meal-Master users</para>

As with other <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> components, the user interface appears in the right pane under the heading <emphasis>Diet Helper</emphasis>.</para>

<para>To start setting up your menus, the first thing your have to do is select the number of days that you are planning for and the number of meals per day.</para>
  
<para>In the rectangular area under the heading <guilabel>Number of Days</guilabel>, the number of days is set at <quote>- 1 -</quote>.  To increase this value, click and hold the &LMB; and move the slider to the right.  The value will increment up to <quote>- 6 -</quote> and then, change to <quote>- 1 week -</quote>.  After the number of days changes to <quote>- 1 week -</quote>, increases are in increments of 1 week to a maximum of 4 weeks.</para>

<para>Similarly, in the rectangular area under the heading <guilabel>Meals per Day</guilabel>, the number of meals displays as <quote>- 1 -</quote>.  This value is incremented by clicking and holding the &LMB; and moving the slider to the right until the desired number of meals is displayed, up to a maximum of 10.  When the slider is adjusted, a tab will appear for each of the meals.</para>

<para>The next step is to specify the number of dishes per meal.  This is done by using the spinbox beside the <guilabel>No. of dishes:</guilabel> label to adjust the number.</para>
  
<para>Beside the <guilabel>No. of dishes:</guilabel> are the <guibutton>Previous Dish</guibutton> and <guibutton>Next Dish</guibutton> buttons that are used to navigate back and forth between dishes as you specify the type of recipe for each.  As you utilize these buttons to move back and forth between dishes, you will note that in the <emphasis>Dish Characteristics</emphasis> area of the screen, the dish label changes as follows &mdash;</para>

<itemizedlist><listitem><para><guilabel>1st Course</guilabel></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><guilabel>2nd Course</guilabel></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><guilabel>Dessert</guilabel></para></listitem>

<title>Planning Menus</title>
<para>In the <emphasis>Dish Characteristics</emphasis> area of the screen and beside the dish label, there is a tick box to <guilabel>Enable Category Filtering</guilabel>.  Clicking this box <action>enables the feature</action>.  It is important that you choose to do this because you may otherwise end up having <emphasis>Cheesecake</emphasis>, or some other unreasonable dish for breakfast!</para>

<para>With <quote>category filtering</quote> turned on, you can select the category to be used for the dish as specified by the dish label located beside the category selection box.  For instance, the dish label might show <guilabel>1st Course</guilabel>.  If you are selecting courses for your dinner meal, you might then select the category <emphasis>Salads</emphasis> from the category list.  A scrollbar exists to the right that allows moving up and down within the list.</para>

<para>Continuing with the example of selecting dishes for your dinner meal, you would then click the <guibutton>Next Dish</guibutton> button.  When you do this, you will note that the dish label changes to <guilabel>2nd Course</guilabel> and that again, you must turn <emphasis>category filtering</emphasis> on.  Now, you can proceed with the selection of the category for your next dish, for example, <emphasis>Pasta</emphasis>.</para>

<para>Continue selecting the types of dishes for your meals in this same manner.  When you have completed selecting the types of dishes, at this point, you can click the <guibutton>Create the diet</guibutton> button.</para>

<note><para>At this point, you are planning a menu only and not taking any dietary and nutrient constraints into consideration.  To plan menus and consider nutrient consumption, see the section <link linkend="plan-menu-diet">Planning Diet-Conscious Menus</link>.</para></note>

<para>When you click the <guibutton>Create the diet</guibutton> button, the <interface>Diet</interface> window appears which displays your menus for the number of days that you have selected.  In this window, you can click the <guibutton>Create Shopping List</guibutton> button to create the shopping list for your menus.  You can also choose to <action>print the menu</action> by clicking the <guibutton>Print</guibutton> button.

<title>Planning Diet-Conscious Menus</title>

<para>All the steps listed in the section <link linkend="menu-plan-only">Planning Menus</link> also apply here.  This section will discuss the incorporation of nutrient values into your menus.</para>

<para>Before you can include nutrients in your menu plan, you must ensure the following &mdash;</para>

<orderedlist><listitem><para>Nutrients or <emphasis>properties</emphasis> must be loaded for the ingredients.  See the section <link linkend="ingredient-properties">Properties in Ingredients</link> for futher instructions.  If an ingredient does not contain nutrient values, it will be ignored.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Units of measure must be associated with the ingredients. Since most nutrients are measured in <emphasis>g/g</emphasis> or <emphasis>mg/g</emphasis>, ensure that <emphasis>g</emphasis> is one of the units associated with each ingredient.  See the section <link linkend="ingredient-units">Units in Ingredients</link> for additional information.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The equivalencies between the units of measure must be completed in the <quote>Units Component</quote> within the <guilabel>Unit Conversions</guilabel> tab.  See the section <link linkend="set-equivalents">Setting Equivalencies</link> for instructions.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>Once you have ensured that all necessary details have been provided for your ingredients, you are ready to consider nutrients in your menu plan.  Of course, attending to these details should be done prior to the start of creating your menu/diet, since the consideration of nutrient values is a continuation of planning a basic menu.</para>

<para>In the portion of the screen that lists the nutrients, under the heading <guilabel>Enabled</guilabel>, select the nutrient that you want to consider by clicking on the tick box that appears to the left of the nutrient name.  Note that you do not have to select <emphasis>every</emphasis> ingredient, only those that you wish to take into consideration.  A scrollbar exists to the right that allows moving up and down within the list.</para>

<para>To the right of the nutrient name, columns labeled <guilabel>Min. Value</guilabel> and <guilabel>Max. Value</guilabel> exist.  These are used to set the minimum and maximum values of nutrients so that when the search for appropriate recipes is done, only recipes that have a particular nutrient falling into the specified range will be considered for your menu/diet.</para>
  
<para>To set the minimum value for the nutrient in question, double-click on the <quote>0</quote> beside the nutrient name and under the <guilabel>Min. Value</guilabel>.  A spinbox will appear that you can utilize to set the value that you want, or you can highlight the <quote>0.00</quote> value and manually type the value that you want to set. Once the desired value has been entered, click the <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to set it.  Likewise, the maximum value is set in the same way under the <guilabel>Max. Value</guilabel> heading.  These steps must be completed in each course category for each nutrient that you want to consider.</para>

<para>It should be noted that you may omit providing a minimum value for a nutrient, in which case the minimum value would remain as <quote>0</quote>.  However, if you provide a minimum value, you must provide a maximum because, obviously, a maximum cannot be less than a minimum.</para>

<note><para>At any point in the process of planning a menu/diet, you can click the <guibutton>Clear</guibutton> to clear all entries and begin again.</para></note>

<para>Once you have completed entering all the nutrient information, click the <guibutton>Create the diet</guibutton> to create your menu/diet.</para>

<para>When you click the <guibutton>Create the diet</guibutton> button, the <interface>Diet</interface> window appears which displays your menus for the number of days that you have selected.  In this window, you can click the <guibutton>Create Shopping List</guibutton> button to create the shopping list for your menus.  You can also choose to <action>print the menu</action> by clicking the <guibutton>Print</guibutton> button.

<para>Below the <guilabel>Search:</guilabel> box, under the heading <guilabel>Ingredient</guilabel> there is a list of all the ingredients that are in the <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> database, both ones provided by default and those that you have entered by either adding them in the <quote>Ingredients</quote> component or by entering them in a recipe, which automatically adds the ingredient to the database.  Elsewhere in this document, further information is provided on the use of the <link linkend="ingredients-component">Ingredients Component</link>.</para>
 
<para>Beside each ingredient in the list is a tick box which will allow the selection of the ingredient(s) that you have on hand that might be utilizied in some of your recipes.  <action>Click on the tick box</action> to select the ingredient.  The scrollbar to the right of the list allows you to scroll through the entire list of ingredients.  <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> dictates that at least one of the selected ingredients be in each of the recipes listed in the search results.</para>

<para>Before the recipes containing the selected ingredients will display, you must select the number of missing ingredients permitted in your recipes.  This is accomplished by using the spinbox beside the label <guilabel>Missing ingredients allowed:</guilabel>.  There will always be certain ingredients that you have on hand, for example, <emphasis>Salt</emphasis> or <emphasis>Sugar</emphasis>.  One of the purposes of allowing missing ingredients is to compensate for those ingredients that are normally in your cupboard.</para>
  
<caution><para>Setting the missing ingredients too high will result in a longer list of recipes.  Setting the missing ingredients too low will result in either no recipes being found, or cause the search to exclude recipes that you might also be able to make had you allowed for slightly more missing ingredients.</para></caution>
  
<para>Click the <guibutton>Find matching recipes</guibutton> button to display the search results in the area that, by default, displays <emphasis>Possible recipes with the specified ingredients</emphasis>.  The recipe title will appear under the heading <guilabel>Title</guilabel>.  The recipe id will appear under the heading <guilabel>Id</guilabel> and the missing ingredients will display under the heading <guilabel>Missing ingredients</guilabel>.  The width of the columns that apply to each of these headings can be adjusted for viewing purposes.  The recipe list provided by the search is further sectioned under a heading that specifies the number of missing ingredients.</para>

<para>If your search does not provide recipes that are of interest, you can adjust the number of missing ingredients and click the <guibutton>Find matching recipes</guibutton> button to display new results based on the ingredients selected.  Alternatively, you can press the <guibutton>Clear recipe list</guibutton> button to clear the recipe list to perform a whole new search with different ingredients.</para>

<para><emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> makes in easy for you to find a recipe that you can make with ingredients on hand.

<para>In the <guilabel>Units</guilabel> tab, a list of all the units of measure will appear.

<para>For instance, down the left side of the spreadsheet, suppose there is a unit of measure labelled <emphasis>pound</emphasis>.  Using the <quote>horizontal scroll bar</quote> at the bottom of the window, scroll until the unit <emphasis>ounces</emphasis> is revealed along the top.  Double-click the cell that is beside <emphasis>pound</emphasis> and below <emphasis>ounces</emphasis>.  This will cause a <quote>spinbox</quote> to appear with a value set to <quote>0.00000</quote> that can be utilized to set the equivalency to <emphasis>16</emphasis> &ndash; <abbrev>i.e.</abbrev> there are 16 ounces in a pound.  Once the value of <emphasis>16</emphasis> has been set, click the <guibutton>OK</guibutton> button.</para>

<para>In a similar manner, the equivalency between pound and grams could be set by double-clicking on the appropriate cell.  However, in this instance, it is unlikely that you would want to use the spinbox to increment the value to 454.  To allow the manual typing of the value, simply position the cursor by clicking at the beginning of the <quote>0.00000</quote> value and type <userinput>454</userinput>.  Click the <guibutton>OK</guibutton> button, or simply hit the <keycap>Enter</keycap> key to complete.</para>

<para>Once the <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> program knows the equivalency, it can automatically calculate other equivaliencies.  For example, if the program has been informed that there are 16 ounces in a pound, <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> will automatically calculate that 1 ounce is equal to 0.0625 pounds.</para>

<para>Also exclusive to the <guilabel>Server Settings</guilabel> screen, is the <guilabel>Re-run wizard on next startup</guilabel> tickbox that can be selected to reload the database with the recipes and USDA data that come as defaults with the &krecipes; program.</para>

<para>Like accessing the <interface>Krecipes Preferences - Krecipes</interface> <guilabel>Server Settings</guilabel> preferences, you access the <guilabel>Formatting</guilabel> preferences, by first choosing <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> and <guimenuitem>Configure &krecipes;...</guimenuitem> from the &krecipes; menu and then, choosing the <guilabel>Formatting</guilabel> option that appears on the left of the window.</para>

<para>From this window, there are two formatting preferences that can be customized &mdash;</para>

<orderedlist><listitem><para><guilabel>Number Format</guilabel> &ndash; either <guilabel>Fraction</guilabel> or <guilabel>Decimal</guilabel> can be selected by clicking on the appropriate radio button and this choice controls how the units of measure will display in your recipes</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><guilabel>Ingredient</guilabel> format &ndash; this controls how the ingredients are listed in your recipes</para>
<para>You will notice from the screenshot that each portion of the ingredient has a variable associated with it, <emphasis>%n</emphasis> for <quote>Name</quote>, <emphasis>%p</emphasis> for <quote>Preparation method</quote>, <emphasis>%a</emphasis> for <quote>Amount</quote>, <emphasis>%u</emphasis> for <quote>Unit</quote>.  The chosen order for display of these items appears in the <guilabel>Ingredient format:</guilabel> textbox and can be changed at will.  For example, as shown in the screenshot, the <emphasis>%a %u %n%p</emphasis> ingredient format will result in an ingredient being displayed as follows &mdash;</para>
