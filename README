Krecipes is a Recipe Book for KDE. It requires KDE 3.1 or greater (and Qt 3.1 or greater)


First of all, make sure you have at least one of the two necessary databases installed: SQLite or MySQL. In case you decide to use MySQL, make sure also that you have Qt's MySQL plugin properly installed. The program won't work without database support.
 
**  Building The Latest (beta 0.7.2) Release
 
 Just untar the package first:
 
 tar -zxf krecipes_beta_0.7.2.tar.gz
 
 And compile (see ./configure --help for more compile options like '--prefix' and '--with-qt-dir')
 
 ./configure
 make
 make install
 
 
** Downloading And Compiling Through CVS
 
 The project is now being developed under the module kdeextragear-3 in KDE's servers. 

Please notice that this application is beta, meaning everything is expected to work, but the possibility is there that some things might not.  Note that the more our users tells us about bugs, the faster we can find them and fix them.


 
 To download the package, do:
 
 export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.kde.org:/home/kde
 cvs login (When prompted for the password just type return)
 cvs co -l kdeextragear-3
 cvs co kdeextragear-3/krecipes
 cvs co kde-common
 ln -s ../kde-common/admin kdeextragear-3/
