Changes from 2.0-beta2 to 2.0.0:
  * When configuring the database with the setup assistant, the import of
    sample data and USDA database is now done in single large transactions,
    this leads to a huge execution time improvement for that data imports.
  * Fix a crash when the recipe print preview dialog is closed.
  * MySQL tables now use UTF8 as encoding, this avoids breaking some random
    non-ascii characters if the MySQL tables happen to be configured to store
    strings in latin1.
  * Fix a problematic iterator usage which was crashing the ingredient matcher.
    (closes bugs.kde.org #261163)

Changes from 2.0-beta1 to 2.0-beta2:
  * Replaced shorcut for export action. It was ctrl+P, now it is ctrl+O.
  * Use .setPlainText() and .toPlainText() rather than .setText() and .text()
    when dealing with the recipe instructions KTextEdit because the latter
    couple of methods guess if the text is in plain format or HTML and I found
    that sometimes (after spellchecking the instructions, but I don't know how
    to reproduce the problem) the guess is wrong and, for example, the database
    might store the instructions in HTML which is not what we want.
  * Due to a bug which affects only 2.0-beta1, conversion tables were not being
    displayed properly, fixed.
  * Pass "--inserts" intead of "-d" to pg_dump command, so the backup works
    with PostgreSQL 8.x series.
  * Revert a wrong bug fix done in previous release, now the message which
    warns that you are using the same layout for printing and viewing recipes
    is displayed when it should.
  * Escape backslashes when storing strings in the database.
  * Update some sections of the user manual, note that it's still not finished.
  * Don't crash in SelectPropertyDialog when the "Per units:" combo box starts
    being empty, you type something in the combo box and you accept the dialog.
  * When you edit property information for an ingredient, you don't select any
    property but you type a new unit in the "Per Units:" combo box and you
    accept the dialog, don't add that unit to the unit list of the ingredient.
  * Bug fixes/improvements regarding spell checking:
    + Use our own local configuration (in krecipesrc), as configured by the
      settings dialog. If we don't have a local configuration yet, it would try
      to fall back to the user's global configuration (stored in sonnetrc).
    + Don't disable the spell checking automatically.
    + Reload background spell checker if the configuration changes, thusly you
      can, for instance, change the language for spell checking and use it
      inmediatly without restarting the program.
    + Respect the "Automatic spell checking enabled by default" option.

Changes from 2.0-alpha6 to 2.0-beta1:
  * Various changes to make the windows able to be smaller than 800x600.
  * The setup assistant, preferences dialog and advanced search dialog follow
    the HIG about form label alignment, we are using QFormLayout. Thank you to
    Mike Ferguson for doing the advanced search dialog.
  * Added an exporter for MasterCook *.mx2 files. Thank you to Warren Severin
    for writing it.
  * Porting of datablock classes to Qt4.
  * Renamed internal library libkrecipescommon to avoid double lib in filename
  * Execute tests via CTest. To run them use "make test".
  * Made data of some datablock classes private, added get/set methods and unit
    tests.
  * Don't ask x times to delete x recipes.
  * Switch to bugs.kde.org to manage bug reports.
  * Some strings calling SQLite "server" replaced with more appropiate ones.
    Fixes sourceforge #2943981.
  * Provide a copy of KRatingPainter and KRatingWidget to not link against
    Nepomuk, this would prevent the need of rebuilding other packages just to
    install Krecipes for gentoo users with semantic-desktop disabled. Thanks to
    Samuli Suominen for noticing the problem.
  * Using a QSplitter on the ingredient matcher dialog.
  * Fixes for bugs:
    + Right pane header, diet helper title and list titles follow theme colour
      settings rather than set absolute colours. Thanks to Mike Ferguson for the
      patches.
    + When you click on a recipe in the advanced search dialog results, the
      recipe actions (i.e. edit, export...) are updated properly.
    + You can rename the properties (in data -> properties).
    + Use WebKit instead of KHTML for printing recipes, fixes sourceforge
      #2990118 and #2960140.
    + Convert preparation times to QString before reading them from the
      database. Fixes sourceforge #2960133, note that I think that this bug is
      not reproducible.
    + Don't show the help button in the setup assistant dialog, it's not useful
      at the moment.
    + When configuring the page or print layout the program warns that you are
      using the same layout for printing and viewing only when you're really
      using the same layout, in previous releases the warning was shown always
      (unless you check "Do not show this message again").
    + When you edit the amount for a property of an ingredient (click data ->
      ingredients in the left panel, select an ingredient, click "Property
      Information") you can type more than 2 decimal numbers.
    + When you edit amounts for a weight of an ingredient, if you type a wrong
      number/fraction the program will reject the change.
    + When you edit the "Per Amount"  field for a weight of an ingredient, the
      combobox in the dialog asking for the new data shows always
      "-No Preparation-" (as it should be), however, in previous releases
      sometimes the combobox was showing an empty string.
    + In earlier releases when you edit a recipe, move an ingredient up or down
      changing the ingredient group (aka "header") of the ingredient and you
      delete it, the application will crash.
    + Shopping list addition now works properly even if you have the same
      ingredient in different ingredient groups. Fixes sourceforge #1880424.
    + In earlier versions, when you choose import USDA data in the
      corresponding assistant page, if you click back and next again and there
      are no translations of the USDA data for your current locale you will be
      asked if you want to import the data in English.

Changes from 2.0-alpha5 to 2.0-alpha6:
  * Removed unnecesary build dependencies, so you don't need to link against:
    + MySQL development libraries.
    + PostgreSQL develpment libraries.
  * Fix FTBFS with GCC 4.5, thanks to Pino Toscano for fixing it.
  * Fixes for bugs:
    + When you rename an unit (typing ctrl+r or right click -> rename) you can
      change the type of the unit in the shown dialog, however previous releases
      ignore what type you select, keeping the same type for the modified unit.
    + Clear rlist properly in QSqlRecipeDB::loadRecipes(rlist,..) which might
      fix sourceforge #2934428.
    + Don't double categories when amending recipe categories having nested
      categories. Fixes sourceforge #2933497.
    + Don't crash when removing a recipe from a category. Fixes sourceforge
      #2934312.
    + When you remove a recipe from a category, the recipe is properly placed
      in "Uncategorized", even when you're limiting the number of categories to
      display in the GUI list. You can reproduce the (now fixed) bug thusly:
      create a recipe included in 3 categories; a, z1 and z2, limit the number
      of categories to display, make sure that this z1 and z2 categories are not
      displayed in the first page, remove the recipe from the a category and the
      recipe will be added to "Uncategorized" which is wrong.

Changes from 2.0-alpha4 to 2.0-alpha5:
  * Fixed issues in i18n strings, most of them reported by Krazy. Thanks to Mike
    Ferguson who did most of this work.
  * Created static library libkrecipescommon. This makes the project to compile
    very much faster when compiling the test programs.
  * Added KUIT and context stuff to a huge number of i18n strings. Thanks to
    Mike Ferguson who did most of this work.
  * When you try to load USDA property information in the EditPropertiesDialog
    the program warns you if you didn't select one ingredient in the USDA
    ingredient list.
  * Updated Unai Garro e-mail; replaced <ugarro@users.sourceforge.net> with
    <ugarro@gmail.com>.
  * Fixes for bugs:
    + Don't crash when closing the "Page Setup" and "Print Setup" dialogs.
    + Uncategorized recipes are displayed when using MySQL 4, this fixes
      sourceforge #2878934. Thanks to Mike Ferguson for his help and feedback
      about this bug.
    + When removing a category a recipe is moved to the "Uncategorized" folder
      (we're talking only about the UI) only if the recipe is not included in
      other categories.
    + Correct imprecision when typing float numbers for ingredient amounts in
      the recipe editor. The problem was that the program was converting numbers
      from float to mixed and from mixed to float again and again. For instance,
      if you type 2/3 in a previous release you will get it converted to 0.75
      instead of the expected 0.666666... or so. Also the changes for fixing
      this bug cause that you will not see fractions in the ingredients tab, no
      matter what you choosed in "Settings -> Configure -> Formatting -> Number
      format", however, this is not a problem; if you want to see the numbers as
      fractions just choose "Fraction" as number format, select your recipe and
      click on "Show recipe".
    + In the ingredients tab from the recipe editor you are able to amend
      amounts. In previous releases when you type an invalid number/interval
      you get a blank field in the list. Now, when you type some invalid thing
      as ingredient amount like "3/" the program will keep the old value.
    + In 1.0 series the program was displaying in a tooltip the date when a
      recipe was created, modified and last accessed; however this doesn't work
      for the previous 2.0 releases. In this release, when you select a single
      recipe you can see the dates mentioned above in the status bar.
    + The dialog to edit the weights and properties for a given ingredient
      loads also the property information from USDA database when clicking on
      "Load" button, not just the weights. Fixes sourceforge #2897458.
    + Advanced search is performed properly; when you search by some field(s)
      providing its value(s) you will not get the recipes whose field(s)
      contains the given value(s) as a substring, you will get the recipes whose
      fields match exactly with the given value(s). Note that if you want to
      search a substring in a field, you can do it passing *mysubstring* because
      wildcards are supported.
    + Refreshed KDateEdit and KDatePickerPopup, taken from 4.3 branch; this
      allows you to type dates.
    + The search by preparation time works.
    + The clear button in the ingredient matcher clears the lists used to
      perform the search; in previous releases if you push the clear button the
      ingredients in the list placed on the right side would count for future
      searches.
    + If you set in Settings -> Configure Krecipes -> Performance something
      different to "Unlimited", you may see the special items "Next" and
      "Previous" in lists. Due to some wrong connect(...) calls in previous
      releases if you push some of this special buttons and you create a new
      element in the list, you will see the new element repeated various times.
    + Make the drag & drop for recipe photos work again.
    + The dropdown list for the combo box to edit headers (ingredient groups)
      will be updated if you add or remove headers.
    + In previous versions, when you delete a header used in an existing recipe
      the program will say that you are about to delete recipes from your
      database; this message is not true because what the program will do is
      deleting the header in the recipe, i.e. recipes will be modified but not
      deleted.
    + The save button is always enabled when you create a new recipe.
    + The uncategorized recipes are inserted in the user interface by order.
    + The functionality to resize a recipe works even if you have a non blank
      yield type.
    + When editing a recipe if you change the yield type and you click "resize
      recipe" the shown dialog will be aware of the change.
    + "Search as you type" option is now suposed to be applied with all lists in
      the user interface, not just the recipe list in the "find/edit recipes"
      component.

Changes from 2.0-alpha3 to 2.0-alpha4:
  * Fixed issues reported by Sanitizer in the user manual. Note that the user
    manual is a work in progress and it's not finished yet.
  * Keep the export action enabled when we are at select recipe dialog or
    ingredient matcher dialog even while we have no recipes selected.
  * Restored the button to remove criteria in the advanced search dialog.
  * Fixes for bugs:
    + In the Ingredient Matcher from previous versions when selecting various
      ingredients and clicking on the right arrow, some ingredients might be
      missing in the list of the right side of the window.
    + No more crashes when dragging categories. Fixes sourceforge #2853112.
    + Ingredient list is cleared properly when clearing the contents for a recipe.
      Fixes sourceforge #2878946. Also, it seems that as side effect, various
      test programs are not segfaulting anymore.
    + Various lists are cleared properly in the mmfimporter; now the mmftest
      exits with success and the mmf importer appears to work.
    + Fixed various bugs in the rezkonv importer and exporter as well as in
      rezkonvtest; now rezkonvtest exits succesfully.
    + Added tests for mxp and mx2 importers, fixed several bugs in these
      importers.
    + The button in the left panel for unsaved recipes is suposed to be hidden
      when necessary. In previous releases I have been seeing it raised when it
      should be hidden, for instance after saving or deleting a recipe.

Changes from 2.0-alpha2 to 2.0-alpha3:
  * krecipes --convert-sqlite3 now gives messages to the user about the success
    or failure of the operation.
  * If the program fails to fix the db structure with SQLite, you can execute
    the sqlite converter clicking a button; you don't need to type commands in
    the shell.
  * You can configure the path for the commands executed by the sqlite
    converter.
  * Using KRatingWidget and KRatingPanter from nepomuk; as side effects we are
    avoiding some crashes when clicking on the old RatingWidget and we have
    refreshed artwork.
  * Updated most screenshots in the user manual, note that the manual is not
    finished yet.
  * Fixes for bugs:
    + The program can be built on Windows, thanks to Patrick Spendrin
      (SaroEngels).
    + The preferences dialog saves paths instead of KUrl's. You can reproduce
      the bug in previous versions, among other ways, using sqlite backend and
      choosing a different sqlite database file, if you check what prefereces
      dialog saved in krecipesrc, you will find something like
      file://path/to/file instead of /path/to/file and if you execute the
      program again, you will get an error message noticing that the database
      cannot be opened.
    + The program doesn't crash if you select a wrong database (i.e. that will 
      fail on connect) in the setup assistant.
    + In the preferences dialog, the checkbox titled "Re-run wizard on next
      startup" now reads the value stored in configuration file. Not doing this
      was a problem because, for instance, you could choose to re-run the
      assistant, and if you changed your mind, you couldn't amend this setting.
    + The setup assistant now stores the value that you choose for remote
      databases' port.
    + The PostgreSQL backend now displays properly the uncategorized recipes.

Changes from 2.0-alpha1 to 2.0-alpha2:
  * The import/export tests are able to build again.
  * The setup assistant allows selecting the port for remote servers.
  * Added button to save recipes' photos as JPEG files.
  * Added a close button in "View Recipe" dialog.
  * Refreshed some icons and artwork. (TODO: stars for rating widget)
  * Updated icons in handbook. Note that the user manual is currently a work in
    progress.
  * Using a QSplitter on the advanced search tab.
  * Fixes for issues reported by krazy:
    + Stop using TRUE and FALSE macros.
  * Fixes for bugs:
    + SQLite backend stores the recipes' photos.
    + Importer for *.kreml and .kre files reads properly the recipes'
      preparation time.
    + Reading float numbers when importing recipeml files is not locale aware.
    + The ratings tab in the recipe editor is not corruptly displayed anymore.
    + The shortcuts work.
    + When you select the PostgreSQL backend and you choose to include the
      sample data, categories_id_seq is updated properly. Closes the
      sourceforge bug number 2364987.
    + When you create a new recipe, a new entry is raised in the left panel
      containing a "save icon" and the title for the recipe, however in
      2.0-alpha1 if you close the recipe whitout saving, a dialog asks you if
      you want to save the changes or not and if you select "no" the entry with
      the title of the recipe located in the left panel will not be hidden.
      This bug is fixed in this version.

Changes from 1.1 to 2.0-alpha1:
  * General port to kde4/qt4, several dialogs and left panel.
  * Use sonnet.
  * Port of backup/restore functions to kde4/qt4.
  * Port of setup assistant to kde4/qt4.
  * Port of preferences dialog to kde4/qt4.
  * Port of sqlite migration code to kde4/qt4.
  * Mimetypes are installed using the Shared Mime-info Database.
  * Updated splash screen with the proper version number.
  * Workaround for a Qt bug in the PostgreSQL driver when getting the database
    version number.
  * Refreshed KDateEdit and KDatePickerPopup (using source from KDE 4.2.4).
  * Using QPointers when showing modal dialogs (it fixes issues reported by
    krazy).
  * Refreshed RatingWidget, which now is licensed under GPL2 + GPL3 + e.v.
    exception, thanks to Robby Stephenson.
  * Stop using some Qt classes that should not be used (it fixes issues
    reported by krazy).

Changes from 1.0-beta2 to 1.1 (1.1 was never released, however the KDE 4 port
is based on 1.1):
  * New recipe layouts, thanks to a new XSL-based template system.
  * New icons and splash screen (courtesy of Robert Wadley).

Changes from 1.0-beta1 to 1.0-beta2:
  * Fix crash with sqlite backend.
  * Fix FTBFS with GCC 4.3.
  * Add categories to desktop file.

Changes from 0.9 to 1.0-beta1:
  * Handbook integration: Removed context help and replaced with links to the
    Handbook. Also "Help" buttons have been added to some dialogs that also
    take users to the Handbook for more info.
  * Nutrient status indicator; while editing a recipe, lets you know whether or
    not nutrient information is complete for a recipe.
  * Measurement Converter tool.
  * Ingredient weights, used for accurate Volume->Mass unit conversions based
    on the ingredient.
  * Improved unit conversions; there's a separate table for mass and volume
    conversions and this setup avoids non-sensical conversions (i.e. 1 loaf =
    ? cups).
  * Optimized for quick loading and faster startup times.
  * Ingredient substitutes (i.e. butter or margarine).
  * Completely re-done recipe view, based on HTML templates. This solves many
    layout problems and should allow creating layouts for printing to 3x5 or
    4x6 cards. Generated HTML is much cleaner and compatible.
  * "Web Book" exporter - exports a collection of recipes into a series of web
    pages, organized by category.
  * Ingredients and properties can be split into a variable number of columns
    in the Page Setup.
  * Select which properties to show in the recipe view.
  [ Notable bugs fixed ]
  * Make dialog windows more KDE standards compliant.
  * Fix displaying photos when special characters are in the title of the
    recipe.
  * Fix database backup for a non-local host.

Changes from 0.8 to 0.9:
  * Rating support: multiple people can rate a single recipe, each rating can
    rate a recipe on multiple criteria (taste, ease of preparation, etc.).
  * New yield property for recipes: rather than storing the number of servings,
    it now stores a yield amount and type. The amount may also be a range.
  * Backup/restore of entire database. This is much faster than exporting/
    importing an database in the Krecipes Format and also includes nutrient
    info and unit ratios.
  * Ingredient amounts can be ranges.
  * Recipe lists now allow selecting multiple recipes. For example, this is
    handy for exporting, viewing, or printing multiple recipes at once.
  * Dialog to paste ingredients into, which Krecipes then automatically parses
    and adds to a recipes.
  * Allows multiple preparation methods.
  * PostgreSQL backend now stable.
  * Now keeps tracks of when recipes are created, modified, and last accessed.
  * 'Copy to Clipboard' feature, which allows easily copying a recipe(s)
    directly to the clipboard in a format that can be configured. There is a
    new export format, Plain Text, that is used by default.
  * Rezkonv file format export.

Changes from 0.7 to 0.8:
  * Redesigned advanced search: search on the "and", "or", and "not"
    conditions of each search term. Can now search on nearly any item possible.
  * Reduce memory requirements for large databases. Very large databases
    should now be possible, though work continues to be put into this. It is
    being tested on a database with 37,000 recipes and counting.
  * Improve recipe import speeds, keeping a fairly constant speed no matter
    what the size of the database.

Changes from 0.6 to 0.7:
  * BETA support for PostgreSQL database backend.
  * Database to database transfer (Remote or local).
  * Support for grouping ingredients. Also imports group information from
    import formats, such as Meal-Master.
  * There's a new intermediate interface between displaying the shopping
    list and selecting recipes for it. Here you can add, remove, or modify
    ingredients used in those selected recipes.
  * Load sample recipes based on locale. If we don't currently have your
    locale, please submit some recipes to us!
  * Border options added to recipe display.
  * Autocomplete ingredients typed in the instructions text edit.
  * Updated USDA data from SR16-1 to SR17 (released September, 2004).
  * 'Configure' options to disable particular backends.
  * Support for drag and drop in the shopping list dialog.
  * Behind the scenes, the internal structure of Krecipes has improved,
    quickly bringing it closer toward our 1.0 release.
  * Overall, more stability, interface, and useability enhancements.

Changes from 0.5 to 0.6:
  * Support for subcategories.
  * Preparation time field for recipes.
  * Rezkonv import filter.
  * Eliminated the dependence on mysql.h (mysql-devel).
  * Advanced search which can search by ingredients, categories, authors,
    servings, and preparation time.
  * Significant speed increases while navigating Krecipes due to the fact
    that reloading all data when switching dialogs is no longer necessary.
  * en renaming an element to something that already exists, merge the two
    into one.
  * Provide popup menus to many listviews for easy access to common functions.
  * Fix display of characters in certain locales (In particular, this fixes
    the problem many people had displaying umlauts).
  * Actually hide items in the Page Setup that aren't going to be shown in
    the recipe view.
  * Allow renaming of unit and prep method once it is entered in the recipe
    input (from the list view).
  * Allow an empty or zero amount and an empty unit for ingredients.
  * Set the cursor to change to the wait cursor for operations that could
    take more than a few seconds -- this makes the app seem more responsive.
  * Fix some escape/encoding issues in the generated HTML.
  * Support for SQLite 3.
  * Add a Reload and Edit action to the menu.
  * Accessibility improvements.

Most important changes from 0.4 to 0.5:
  * Ingredient matcher - select what ingredients you have, and find out what
    you can make with them.
  * A new field for ingredients: preparation method.
  * Easier and faster imports.
  * Load nutrient data from the USDA's nutrient database.
  * Layouts can now be saved and loaded from files in the Krecipes layout
    format.
  * Improved locale support.
  * Category and author names can now be up to 40 and 50 characters
  respectively
    (previously 20).
  * Complete keyboard navigation now possible.

Most important new features from 0.3 to 0.4:
  * New Krecipes file format for recipe exchange! (.kre compressed, and .kreml
    plain XML).
  * Import Filters for other programs: MasterCook Export (mx2), MasterCook
    Export (mxp) and MealMaster.

  * Renaming of units and ingredients.
  * Resizing of photos.
  * Improved shopping list presentation.
  * New smaller and smarter layout for editing recipes.
  * i18n: Language support: English, Spanish, French and Euskara.
  * UTF support.
  * Thousands of other touches and bugfixes.
