* Importing recipes from *.kreml files does not work with PostgreSQL backend,
  loading the examples from the setup assistant does not work for the same
  reason.

* Click Ingredient Matcher on left panel, select several random ingredients and
  click on the right arrow; some ingredients might be missing in the right
  list.

* On my debian system, if I don't provide a password for PostgreSQL, krecipes
  silently fails.

* All importer/exporter tests are failing or giving warnings except kretest.
