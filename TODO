Note that this is only a draft, to get a rough idea about what will be done.

Planned for the next release in 2.0 branch:

 [Mandatory]
 * Fix bugs.
 * Update user manual.
 
 [Brainstorming]
 * When you print recipes, they are printed in no particular order, I guess they
   should be in alphabetical order.
 * D-BUS interface and service menus to import recipes and restore databases.

Planned for the 2.1 branch:

 [Mandatory]
 * The database version number should be a string instead of a float.
 * Remove the internal SQLite backend, Qt 4 supports SQLite.
 * Replace left panel with something better, check what Kontact is using, its
   left panel is superior (it can use small icons without text, which would be
   very appropiate for netbooks) and seems easier to maintain.
 * Solve the issues reported by krazy.
 * Recheck TODOs and FIXMEs in source code.
 * Remove compiler warnings.
 * Check files taken from other projects and explain in a comment where those
   files came from.
 * Update the USDA database.
 * Create a typedef for id type instead of just using 'int'.

 [Brainstorming]
 * Make configurable the length of VARCHAR(%n) fields, for instance, the
   preparation method name.
 * Probably most of SQL queries are not using the word "join", so slow.
 * Replace PanelDeco with KTitleWidget?, see what KPageView can do for you.
 * The strings stored in database are being escaped in
   QSqlRecipeDB::escapeAndEncode() and they are in UTF-8 encoded as latin1:
   should I use QSqlQuery::bindValue()? doing it probably will result in having
   to bump the database schema version number and reencoding the strings.
 * One of the problems to solve if I want to support concurrent access is how to
   update data in the GUI while other client is doing changes in the database.
   It seems this can be solved with LISTEN, NOTIFY and triggers in PostgreSQL.
   See QSqlDriver::subscribeToNotification() which uses LISTEN if I recall
   correctly.

Planned for the 2.2 branch:

 [Mandatory]
 * Remove Q3 support stuff (a huge work).

 [Brainstorming]
 * Allow the user to select the encoding for mmf importer/exporter, note that
   usually mmf export files use iso8859-1, but may use another encoding.
 * Test with large databases.
 * Concurrent database access.
 * Support for unit names in languages with various plural forms.
 * When you re-run the setup assistant, it does not remember your previous
   configuration.
 * Seek and remove the anti-pattern "if ( myList.count() > 0 ) ...".
 * Fix the hidden features: merge similar (categories|ingredients).
 * Some set-up to make the sample recipes translatable by kde i18n teams,
   something like krecipesdata2pot and po2krecipesdata... (ask Pino or someone
   from i18n team before coding these programs)
 * Try apidox.

Planned for 2.3 branch:

 [Brainstorming]
 * Akonadi backend?
 * Secure database access passwords?
 * Calendar for meal planning, also you could export the data to iCalendar
   using the KDE PIM libs, making it work with KOrganizer.
 * Use qt designer?
 * Add comments to preparation methods and ingredients in a recipe? (see the
   Bill's usecase).
 * Nepomuk support?
 * GHNS for recipes layout?
 * Tags for recipes?
 * Trash folder to store removed recipes?
 * Something to manage money cost in shopping list.
 * Step-by-Step recipe instructions with photos?
 * There is something called eurofir out there.

Old stuff from previous maintainers:

jkivlighn:

MAJOR FEATURES:
	*Command-line interface
	*Improved printing support: I'd like to allow, for example, printing on recipe cards.
	*Handle "Cookbooks".  In MySQL/PostgreSQL a cookbook would be a table, and in SQLite it would be a file.
	*Recipe revisions (planned for 1.1)

CONVENIENCES/MINOR FEATURES:
	*Improved navigation - add a forward and back button
	*E-mail recipe(s) option (using kapp->invokeMailer())
	*Give option to import recipe formats by pasting the recipe text into a widget
	*Allow saving and loading diet info from a file (or just store it in the database?)
	*Database maintenance options (Empty database, Remove unused elements, etc.)
	*Configurable shopping list (Maybe allow the user to select a style sheet or add a section to settings dialog... or both)

BUGS/OTHER:
	*Let user know when no layout file was found
	*The icons on the left menu at times will disappear... I can't seem to reproduce this, however
	*Make use of transactions in database backends where appropriate
	*Give a warning when deleting categories (such as when a recipe was a part of that category)
	*Delete the database table when deleting Krecipes
	*Give a message box when exporting recipes, letting the user know what they are exporting (Is it the whole database, just what is visible, or a specific recipe)... Make it a "Don't ask me again" dialog.

THOUGHTS (feel free to comment):
	*Recipe copy
	*Reference a recipe to a cookbook (title, page number, category, etc.)

uga:
(I don't claim ownership of these. If you do it, I'll be happy too :) )

planned for 0.8:
	*Check ingredients from existing kitchen resource table?
	*Add an option to popup for newly created ingredients, and include the USDA nutritional info at the same time
