Krecipes is a Recipe Book for KDE. It requires KDE 4.4 or greater (and Qt 4).
Developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux sid (KDE 4.4.5 and Qt 4.6.3).


** Dependencies

Additionally to whatever Krecipes is linked against, you will need the client
programs (i.e shell commands sqlite3, mysql ... ) for your database if you want
to use the Krecipes backup feature. If you want to use "krecipes
--convert-sqlite3" you will need both sqlite and sqlite3 shell commands.

** Build Dependencies

 If you're using a Debian-like GNU/Linux distribution you may want to install
 the following packages: 
  - kdelibs5-dev
  - libqimageblitz-dev 
  - libsqlite3-dev or libsqlite0-dev
  - libxml2-dev
  - libxslt1-dev
