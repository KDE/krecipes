Krecipes is a Recipe Book for KDE. It requires KDE 4.2 or greater (and Qt 4)


First of all, make sure you have at least one of the three necessary databases installed: SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL. In case you decide to use MySQL or PostgreSQL, make sure also that you have Qt's MySQL or PostgreSQL plugin properly installed. The program won't work without database support.
