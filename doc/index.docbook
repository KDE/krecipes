system. Any chapter labelled (OPTIONAL) may be left out at the author's
discretion. Other chapters should not be left out in order to maintain a
consistent documentation style across all KDE apps. -->

<sect3 id="using-adv-ingredients">
<title>The Ingredients Search</title>

<para>In the <emphasis><guilabel>Ingredients</guilabel></emphasis> component
of the <emphasis><guilabel>Advanced</guilabel></emphasis> tab, single or
multi-word ingredients can be searched for. Single word ingredients are entered
in the text box with a space between each ingredient.  Multi-word ingredients
are enclosed in quotes, for example, "ice cream".</para>

<para>Searches may also be done using wild cards &ndash; <quote>*</quote>
to replace any number of characters, or <quote>?</quote> to replace a single
character.  For an explanation on the use of wildcards, see the section
<link linkend="using-wildcards">Using Wildcards in Searches</link>.</para>

<note><para>Although the ingredient that you are searching for might appear
in the title of the recipe listed in the search results, it is the ingredient
that has caused a particular recipe to show in the list, NOT the fact that
the ingredient name might appear in the title.</para></note>

<para>Recipes can be searched for based on various criteria &mdash;</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para><emphasis><guilabel>Uses all:</guilabel></emphasis> &ndash;
If the search terms are entered in this text box, it is being stated that
the recipe(s) <emphasis>MUST</emphasis> contain all ingredients listed
and therefore, only those recipes that contain <emphasis>ALL</emphasis>
ingredients will be returned as results of the search.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis><guilabel>Uses any of:</guilabel></emphasis>
&ndash; If the search terms are entered in this text box, it is being stated

search parameters in the <emphasis><guilabel>Categories</guilabel></emphasis>
component are entered with a space between each parameter, or enclosed in
quotes for multi-word parameters.  You can also use wildcards for searching
categories.  See the section, <link linkend="using-wildcards">Using Wildcards

<para>Searching for recipes in
<emphasis><guilabel>Categories</guilabel></emphasis> is done by specifying
the criteria on which you wish to base the search as follows &mdash;</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis><guilabel>In all:</guilabel></emphasis> &ndash;
indicates that the recipes returned in the search should be in all the
categories listed. This search might be used if you are looking for a recipe
that appears in the <emphasis>Dessert</emphasis> category and also, in the
<emphasis>Cakes</emphasis> category.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis><guilabel>In any of:</guilabel></emphasis>
&ndash; is specifying that recipes returned in the search may be from
<emphasis>ANY</emphasis> of the categories, but a recipe may not necessarily
be found in all categories listed.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis><guilabel>Not in:</guilabel></emphasis> &ndash;
is indicating that the recipes returned in the search <emphasis>MUST
NOT</emphasis> be from the categories listed.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The use of the <emphasis><guilabel>Categories</guilabel></emphasis>
search is most useful when combined with other search parameters.</para>

<title>The Authors Search</title>

<para>Are you looking for a recipe given to you by a certain person or
input into <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> from a specific magazine?
The <emphasis><guilabel>Authors</guilabel></emphasis> component of the
<emphasis><guilabel>Advanced</guilabel></emphasis> tab allows you to find
that recipe!</para>

<para>As with the searches previously described, you can search using
wildcards.  For a description of using wildcards, see the section <link
linkend="using-wildcards">Using Wildcards in Searches</link>.  Names are
entered with a space between if, for instance, you are searching for a recipe
by only a first name.  Whole names, or for situations where you have entered
a magazine name as the recipe source (Author), the name is entered enclosed
in quotes, for example, <quote><emphasis>Jason Kivlighn</emphasis></quote>,
or <quote><emphasis>Vegetarian Times</emphasis></quote>.</para>

<para>Searches can be performed in the following ways &mdash;</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis><guilabel>By any of:</guilabel></emphasis>
&ndash; This search would be used if the recipes desired are
by <emphasis>ANY</emphasis> of the authors listed in the text
box.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis><guilabel>By all:</guilabel></emphasis>
&ndash; This search would be used in situations where recipes
have <quote>co-authors</quote>.  An example of this would
be:  <emphasis><quote>Canadian Living Cooks</quote></emphasis>
<emphasis><quote>Elizabeth Baird</quote></emphasis>.  This would
return only recipes where <emphasis>Canadian Living Cooks</emphasis>
and <emphasis>Elizabeth Baird</emphasis> are both listed as the recipe
source/author.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis><guilabel>Not by:</guilabel></emphasis> &ndash;

<sect3 id="using-adv-yield">
<title>The Yield Search</title>

<para>The <emphasis><guilabel>Yield</guilabel></emphasis> component in
the <emphasis><guilabel>Advanced</guilabel></emphasis> tab is slightly
different from the searches described thus far in that it must be
<emphasis>Enabled</emphasis> in order to have it utilized in the search
criteria.</para>

<para>To enable <emphasis><guilabel>Yield</guilabel></emphasis>
as a criteria for your search, click the tick box beside the
<emphasis><guilabel>Enabled</guilabel></emphasis> label.  Once you have
designated this to be part of your search, you can define the yield by
selecting from the drop-down menu as follows &mdash;</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis><guilabel>Yields at least:</guilabel></emphasis>
&ndash; This would be specified if you want the recipe(s) to be able
to provide a minimum number of portions.  The recipe(s) returned COULD
yield <emphasis>MORE</emphasis> than this number, but cannot yield
less.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis><guilabel>Yields at most:</guilabel></emphasis>
&ndash; This would be specified if you want recipe(s) that are returned in
the search to yield <emphasis>NO MORE THAN</emphasis> a specified number
of portions.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis><guilabel>Yields about:</guilabel></emphasis>
&ndash; This would be used to approximate the number of portions you want
in the recipe(s). The recipes(s) returned could yield <emphasis>SLIGHTLY
MORE</emphasis> or <emphasis>SLIGHTLY LESS</emphasis> than a specified number
of portions.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>After defining the type of search that is desired, the spinbox next
to the drop-down menu is used to increment (or decrement) the actual
<emphasis>yield amount</emphasis> that goes along with the defined
parameters.</para>

<note><para>When inputting recipes, a <emphasis>yield type</emphasis>,
for example, <emphasis>servings</emphasis> or <emphasis>dozen</emphasis>
is allowed.  Keep in mind that when including <emphasis>Yield</emphasis>
as a search parameter, using a yield of 2 in a search will return results
for 2 dozen, 2 servings, 2 loaves, but will <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> return
results for 24 cookies, 24 squares, etc., even though these are technically
2 dozen.</para></note>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="using-adv-preptime">
<title>The Preparation Time Search</title>

<para>The <emphasis><guilabel>Preparation Time</guilabel></emphasis> component
in the <emphasis><guilabel>Advanced</guilabel></emphasis> tab is used in the
same manner as the <emphasis><guilabel>Yield</guilabel></emphasis> component.
It must be <emphasis>Enabled</emphasis> in order to have it utilized in the

<para>To enable <emphasis><guilabel>Preparation Time</guilabel></emphasis>
as a criteria for your search, click the tick box beside the

by selecting from the drop-down menu as follows &mdash;</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis><guilabel>Ready in at most:</guilabel></emphasis>
&ndash; This would be utilized if you want the recipe(s) to be ready within a
specified time frame.  The recipe(s) returned COULD be ready in <emphasis>LESS
THAN</emphasis> or <emphasis>EXACTLY</emphasis> the time specified, but cannot
be ready in greater than the time chosen for preparation.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis><guilabel>Ready in about:</guilabel></emphasis>
&ndash; This choice allows some flexibility and would be used to approximate
the time needed to prepare the recipe.	The recipe(s) that are returned
in the search can be ready in <emphasis>SLIGHTLY MORE</emphasis>,
<emphasis>EXACTLY</emphasis>, or <emphasis>SLIGHTLY LESS</emphasis> than
the time specified for preparation.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>After defining the type of search that is desired, the spinbox
next to the drop-down menu is used to increment (or decrement) the
actual <emphasis>time</emphasis> parameter.  Select the digits before the
<emphasis>&#058;</emphasis> symbol to increment the hour portion of the time
and then select the digits after the <emphasis>&#058;</emphasis> symbol to
increment the minute portion of the time.  The hour and minute parameters
can be used alone or in combination.</para>

<para>Are you interested in finding a recipe that contains
certain instructions or is prepared a certain way?  The

been set within the &kde; environment.	For example, if the date format has
been set to display as DD-MM-YYYY, you may enter the date directly into the
text box in the format of "DD-MM-YYYY".  When entering the date, the two
initial digits of the year may be entered, but are not absolutely necessary.
However, it is imperative that you use the exact separator <abbrev>i.e.
</abbrev> the dash (&ndash;), in the example, as set in the date format in
&kde;. You may also use the drop-down arrow beside the box in which you want to
enter the date to reveal a calendar.</para>

<caution><para>If you choose to enter the date directly into the text box
and are using a <emphasis>date range</emphasis> as opposed to an exact date,
ensure that the dates for the start and end of the range are entered in the
same format.  For example, if you enter the starting date for the range in
the format of "DD-MM-YY" and the ending date for the range in the format of
"DD/MM/YY", either no recipes will be found or the results returned will
include only those recipes that fit the criteria for the starting date,
if this date agrees with the format as set in &kde;.</para></caution>

<sect4 id="use-calendar">
<title>Using the Calendar Interface</title>

<para>The calendar allows you to easily navigate though months and years to
select any date.</para>

<para>When the calendar is revealed, the current month is shown and the
current day is highlighted.  Below the calendar is a text box, which shows
the date and beside this a drop-down menu that displays the specific week
of the year.</para>

<para>One way to select a date would be to use the drop-down menu to select a
particular week in the year, for example <guimenuitem>Week 26</guimenuitem>.
Doing this will change the date in the text box and will also position
the highlighted date in the calendar to the beginning of Week 26. Note that
<emphasis>Monday</emphasis> is used as the starting day for the week.  To use
a date from this week either, click the highlighted date in the calendar,
or select another date from the week and the date will be transferred to the
<emphasis>Meta Data</emphasis> text box where the calendar was utilized.</para>

<para>Below the text box that is displaying the date at the beginning of the
chosen week of the year (or the current week if no choice has been made),
there is a list of additional choices for date selection.  Specifically, these
are: &ndash; <emphasis>Today</emphasis>, <emphasis>Tomorrow</emphasis>,
<emphasis>Next Week</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Next Month</emphasis>.
Clicking on one of these selections, will result in this date being shown in
the <emphasis>Meta Data</emphasis> text box being used. It should be noted
here that each of the choices is relevant to today's date.  For instance,
if today's date is the 15th, clicking the <guibutton>Today</guibutton> would
place today's date in the <emphasis>Meta Data</emphasis> text box being used.
Clicking <guibutton>Tomorrow</guibutton> would, of course, place tomorrow's
date in the box.  <guibutton>Next Week</guibutton> would place the date
that is one week forward today in the box. <guibutton>Next Month</guibutton>
would place next month's date that corresponds to today's date in the box,
in the example from above, the 15th of the previous month.</para>

<para>Additionally, the calendar itself can be utilized to navigate to
a specific date.  When the arrow beside the text box in which you want to
display the date is clicked, thus revealing the calendar, there are a number
of ways to select a date &mdash;</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Click on the month displayed &ndash; This will reveal a list
from which you can select a desired month.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Click on the year displayed &ndash; This is reveal a
text box that displays the current year, but in which another year can be
entered.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>To the left and right of the month and year heading
on the calendar, there are arrows that can be used to
navigate through various months and years.  Clicking on the
<guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata  fileref="arrow-left.png"
format="PNG"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon> icon
will reveal the previous month's calendar.  Conversely, clicking the
<guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="arrow-right.png"
format="PNG"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon> icon will advance
the calendar to the next month.</para>

<para>Navigating between years is done in the same manner, but
the <guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata
fileref="arrow-left-double.png"
format="PNG"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon> is used to navigate
to previous years and the <guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata
fileref="arrow-right-double.png"
format="PNG"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon> is used to
navigate to following years.  In each case, once a date is selected, it
will be transferred to the text box at the point where the calendar was
selected.</para>

<para>Additionally, if no range is specified, the search will find recipes
that have an assigned star rating in a range of &#177;&#189; of the value
entered, 3&#189; to 4&#189; stars in the example.</para>

<para>Information for the compilation of the above table can be found at <ulink
url="http://www.usapple.org/consumers/appleguide/equivalents.cfm"></ulink>.</para>

<para>Using the above table and assuming that the size of the apples is
<emphasis>medium</emphasis>, you might add a weigh entry for medium apples in
your ingredient weight table.  See <link linkend="ingredients-component">The
Ingredients Component</link> for explicit instructions on doing this.</para>

<para>The above table indicates that 1 pound of apples is equivalent to
3 medium apples.  However, the weight table in the <emphasis>Ingredients
Component</emphasis> requires that the weight be in <emphasis>grams</emphasis>.
If we know that 1 pound equals 454 grams, and that 3 medium apples
weigh 454 grams, then 1 apple will equal 151.3 grams.  We will assume
that this conversion has been added correctly to your weight table.
Also, if the equivalent has been added to the weight table with no
preparation method specified, you will have to remove the preparation method
<emphasis>sliced</emphasis> in order to completely update the status indicator
for <emphasis>apples</emphasis>.</para>

<tip><para>After adding the weight for <emphasis>apples</emphasis> in the
<emphasis>Ingredients Component</emphasis>, if you return to your recipe
and the <emphasis>LED</emphasis> status indicator hasn't changed, you can
click on it to cause an update.</para></tip>

<para>To assist you with your conversions, <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis>
has a nifty tool that can be found by selecting <guimenu>Tools</guimenu>
and <guimenuitem>Measurement Converter</guimenuitem>.  This helper will
be more fully discussed in <link linkend="measure-converter">Using the
Measurement Converter</link>.</para>

<para>After making the adustment for apples, the <emphasis>LED</emphasis>
status indicator will turn yellow because nutrient information is complete, but
an approximation has been made for the ingredient <emphasis>butter</emphasis>.
The <guilabel>Property Status:</guilabel> of your recipe will show as
<emphasis>Complete, but approximations made</emphasis>.  Here, you can choose
to do one of the following: &mdash;</para>

<para><orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Choose to enter a weight for <emphasis>melted butter</emphasis>
in your weight table</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Accept the approximation, in which case, your status
<emphasis>LED</emphasis> will remain yellow</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Remove the preparation method from <emphasis>butter</emphasis>,
if it will not adversely affect the preparation of your
recipe.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>

<para>Choosing 1 or 3 above will allow <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis>
to obtain accurate weight information for the ingredient and your status
indicator <emphasis>LED</emphasis> will turn green and the <guilabel>Property
Status:</guilabel> will show as <emphasis>Complete</emphasis>.</para>

<para>Find the recipe that you wish to enter into
<emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis>.  Start the interface for
entering a new recipe and enter the appropriate parameters in the
<emphasis><guilabel>Recipe</guilabel></emphasis> tab.  Move to
the <emphasis><guilabel>Ingredients</guilabel></emphasis>

<guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="edit-paste.png"
format="PNG"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon> which appears
as the last item in the group of icons to the right of the ingredient
list.  The recipe ingredients will appear in the upper portion of the
<interface>Ingredient Parser</interface> window.</para>

<para>Make any edits that you wish in this portion of the screen.  For example,
if the recipe lists an ingredient as <emphasis>sugar</emphasis> and you know
that the corresponding item in your ingredient list is <emphasis>granulated
sugar</emphasis>, you may want to change this.	For any ingredient or unit
that you do not alter in this portion of the screen, the ingredient and/or unit
will be added to your ingredient and/or units list if it does not exist.</para>

<para>Once your ingredients are formatted to your liking, click
the <guibutton>Parse Text</guibutton> button.  The ingredient
list will be transferred to the lower portion of the window
beneath the label <emphasis><guilabel>Ingredients as understood by
&krecipes;:</guilabel></emphasis>.  From this portion of the screen, you
can set any <emphasis>Headers</emphasis> by clicking on the <guibutton>Set
Header</guibutton> button to the right.</para>

<para>Click the <guibutton>OK</guibutton> button that appears in the top
right-hand corner of window to transfer your ingredients to your recipe.
You can also choose not to proceed with the addition of the ingredients
by clicking on the <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> button which will close
the window.</para>

<para>Once the ingredients have been transferred into the ingredient list
for your new recipe, they can be moved or removed as describe in the section
<link linkend="ingredients-tab">Entering Recipe Ingredients</link> above.
In addition the amount, unit or preparation methods can be edited, also as
described above.</para>

<para>You can now proceed to enter the recipe instructions as

<para>Entering the recipe instructions is easy &ndash; in the white space

<tip><para>A <emphasis>VERY COOL</emphasis> part of entering the recipe

a real-time and effort saver if your instructions refer to many of the
ingredients in your ingredient list, and/or if your ingredient names are
lengthy.  This is how it works &mdash;</para>

<para>In the <quote>Apple Crisp</quote> recipe shown in the screenshot, we have
the ingredient <quote>brown sugar</quote>.  As you begin typing <quote>brown
sugar</quote> in your recipe instructions, <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis>
will match typed characters with ingredients in your recipe ingredient list
and automatically complete the remaining characters.</para>

<para>For example, if you type <quote>b</quote>, the characters <quote>brown
sugar</quote> are the ones that will be auto-completed and inserted into
the instructions.  The auto-completed characters will appear highlighted and
you can choose to accept the suggested ingredient by pressing the &Enter;
key.</para>

<para>However, suppose that in your instructions, you simply wanted to refer
to <quote>brown sugar</quote> as <emphasis>sugar</emphasis> and you enter
the character <quote>s</quote>.  <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> will search
the ingredients in your recipe and match the first ingredient beginning
with <quote>s</quote> that it finds, if there is one.  If there is no
ingredient in your recipe ingredient list beginning with <quote>s</quote>,
nothing will happen &ndash; you will just continue typing the word
<quote>sugar</quote>.</para>

<para>If there is another ingredient beginning with <quote>s</quote> in
your recipe ingredient list, for instance, <emphasis>salt</emphasis>, the
remaining characters, <abbrev>i.e.</abbrev> the <quote>alt</quote>, will be
auto-completed and highlighted.  Simply press the <keycap>Delete</keycap>
key on the keyboard to remove the unwanted characters and continue typing.
Alternatively, you can just continue typing the entire word and your

<title>Adding Recipe Ratings</title>
<para><emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> allows you to rate your recipes!	Ratings
by multiple people are allowed, so each of your recipe <quote>tasters</quote>
can provide their own input.  Additionally, each rating can include multiple
rating parameters.  The default parameters against which you can rate your
recipe are &mdash;</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Taste</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Appearance</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Ease of Preparation</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Originality</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Overall</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Initially, in the <emphasis><guilabel>Ratings</guilabel></emphasis> tab,
there is only a blank screen with the <guibutton>Add Rating...</guibutton>
button at the bottom.  Clicking this button will start the interface for
entering ratings.</para>

<para>The <emphasis>Ratings</emphasis> interface is comprised of the following
elements &mdash;</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Rater: &ndash; this is the name of the person providing
their opinion of the recipe</para>
<para>To complete this element <userinput>enter the rater's
name</userinput> in the text box that appears beside the label
<emphasis><guilabel>Rater:</guilabel></emphasis>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Criteria: &ndash; this is the criteria on which the recipe
is rated</para>
<para>Select the criteria against which you want to rate
the recipe from the drop-down menu that appears beside the
<emphasis><guilabel>Criteria:</guilabel></emphasis> label. Five default choices
exist for rating criteria, as listed above, but if you have another against
which you want to rate your recipe, it can be typed directly into the text box
and will automatically be added to your rating criteria list.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Stars: &ndash; this is the number of stars that you wish to
assign to the particular criteria that you are rating on</para>

<para>Star ratings are completed by clicking on a star.  Clicking on the
left-hand side of any star will provide a &#189; star rating.  Clicking on
the right-hand side of the star will provide a full star rating.</para>

<tip><para>It is unnecessary to click on each star individually.  For instance,
if you are rating the recipe on the <emphasis>Taste</emphasis> criteria and
you want to assign this a 4&#189; star rating, click on the left hand side
of the 5th star.</para></tip>

<para>Once you have completed the star rating for the recipe, click the
<guibutton>Add</guibutton> button to add the rating to the rating list.
At this point, you can continue to rate the recipe against other criteria
in the same manner.</para>

<para>From within the rating list, both the rating criteria and the star
rating can be edited by double clicking on either item.  The rating criteria
is edited the same way any text edit is done.  To edit the star rating,
double click the stars and then type the numerical value for the number of
stars that you wish to assign to the rating.  Once you press the &Enter;
key, the rating will show the graphical stars.</para>

<para>Should you change your mind and wish to remove any of the
rating criteria, select it in your rating list and click the
<guibutton>Delete</guibutton> button.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>Comments: &ndash; this is any added information that you
wish to note for the recipe, for example, an enhancement to improve the
recipe, or a serving suggestion such as <emphasis>Great served with ice
cream</emphasis></para>

<para>To enter a comment, simply position your cursor in the white space
beneath the <emphasis><guilabel>Comments:</guilabel></emphasis> label and
begin typing.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>Once you are satisfied with your ratings, click the
<guibutton>OK</guibutton> button to complete the addition.  The
<quote>smiley</quote> graphic that appears to the left of the rating list
is indicative of the overall rating of the recipe, from poor to excellent.
This graphic will not appear in your recipe when it is viewed.</para>

<para>Any rating can be removed from the screen by clicking the
<guibutton>Remove</guibutton> button beneath the rating that
you wish to remove.  Additionally, you can use the <keycombo
action="simul">&Alt;<keycap>M</keycap></keycombo> key combination.
A rating can be edited by clicking on the <guibutton>Edit...</guibutton>
button.     When you choose to edit a rating, the same interface that
was used to originally enter the rating is opened.  Each rating has its
own <guibutton>Delete</guibutton> and <guibutton>Edit...</guibutton>

<para>This export format will result in a smaller filesize and as a result

<listitem><para>&krecipes; &ndash; files of this format will have extensions

<para>Using this format exports your recipe in a readable format that makes
it easier to edit the recipe &XML;.</para>

<note><para>When exporting in either &krecipes; and &krecipes; Compressed
format, all information is guaranteed to be preserved.	Other formats may
support only certain information.  If your recipes contain, for example,
<quote>borders</quote> around certain elements, and this is not supported by
the export format that you have specified, that information is lost without
any warning.</para></note></listitem>

<listitem><para>Plain Text &ndash; files of this format will have extensions
of .txt</para>
<para>Using this format exports your recipe information <emphasis>without
the photo</emphasis> into plain text format.  The idea here is not to be
able to import back into <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis>, nor import into
any other recipe format.  The purpose is to be a handy tool for such tasks
as email.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Web Book &ndash; files of this format will have extensions
of .html</para>

<para>This option allows you to export multiple recipes, for instance,
a category.  The cool part about exporting as a Web Book is that you will
be allowed to navigate to specific recipes via links that appear under the
category name at the top of the page.</para>

<para>You might want to use this feature to export recipes from a single
category.  However, you can randomly select recipes from multiple categories to
be exported in this format.  To do this, select the first recipe by clicking
on it and then, hold the &Ctrl; key and select the next and subsequent
recipes.  If recipes are selected randomly, the export will create a page
named <emphasis>index.html</emphasis> in the location that you specify.
This file will have links to the various categories of recipes that you
have exported.</para>

<para>For instance, suppose you have selected to export random recipes
from <emphasis>Appetizers</emphasis>, <emphasis>Main Dishes</emphasis>,
and <emphasis>Desserts</emphasis>.  The index.html file would show links
for <emphasis>Appetizers</emphasis>, <emphasis>Main Dishes</emphasis>, and
<emphasis>Desserts</emphasis>.	Clicking any one of those links will open
the page for that category and you will then be able to navigate through
the recipes within the category by clicking on the recipe name link that
appears under the category name at the top of the page.</para>

<note><para>Once exported in Web Book format, you are unable to import these
recipes back into <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis>.</para></note>

</listitem>

<listitem><para>Web page &ndash; files of this format will have extensions
of .html</para>

<para>You might choose to export in this format in order to create a web
page that contains your recipes.  Similar to exporting as a <emphasis>Web
Book</emphasis>, you can export recipes from a single category, entire
categories or randomly selected recipes from any number of categories.
The difference is that all recipes exported in Web page format will appear on
a single web page with no navigational ability other than scrolling through
the page using the scrollbar.</para>

<para>While exporting in Web page format has its purpose, you will obviously
note the benefits of exporting as a Web Book if you are exporting many
recipes.</para>

<para>However, it should be noted that once exported in Web
page format, you are unable to import these recipes back into
<emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis>.</para>

<note><para>Exporting recipes in either <emphasis>Web page</emphasis> or

you should note that if your choose to export in this format,
certain <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> recipe information will be
lost.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>RecipeML &ndash; files of this format will have extensions

by most recipe software.  However, you may wish to use this format to have
recipes recognized by programs that use it.</para></listitem>

<para>A window will appear that allows you to navigate to location

to your home folder, but another existing folder can be chosen, or
you can create a new folder.  The name of the recipe will appear in
the box labelled <emphasis><guilabel>Location:</guilabel></emphasis>

<para>The <emphasis><guilabel>Filter:</guilabel></emphasis> box is used

deselect to <emphasis><guilabel>Automatically select filename

<para>Once the name of the exported recipe appears in the

<guibutton>Save</guibutton> button to proceed with the export, or the
<guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> button to halt the export process and return
to the previous screen.</para>

<para>When the <guibutton>Save</guibutton> button is clicked, the recipe will
save in the chosen format and you will be able to open it with the program
that accepts that file format &ndash; for example, if you have chosen to
export your recipe in <quote>Meal-Master</quote> format, you will be able
to open it in any program that accepts .mmf format files.  You will also
notice that the export process has created a folder in which the graphics
related to your exported recipe are stored.</para>

<note><para>You may also export categories of recipes or your whole database
in this same manner.  However, if you want to export your entire database, you
must ensure that no recipe or category is selected in your recipe list.</para>

<para>Whether you are exporting a single recipe, a category of recipes or
your entire database, if no recipe or category of recipes is selected,
an alert box will appear containing the message <quote>No recipes are
currently selected.  Would you like to export all recipes in the current
view?</quote>  Click the <guibutton>Yes</guibutton> button (or use the
<keycombo action="simul">&Alt;<keycap>Y</keycap></keycombo>) to proceed
with the export of all recipes.  You can also cancel the process in order to
select recipes for export by clicking the <guibutton>No</guibutton> button
(or use the <keycombo action="simul">&Alt;<keycap>N</keycap></keycombo>
key combination).</para>

<para>If you recall, when <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> starts, by default
the <emphasis>Find/Edit Recipes</emphasis> component is active and if you have
recipes and categories, they appear in the right pane of the window.  At this
point nothing is selected, so you could choose to export your entire database.
However, if there is something selected and you want to export, simply click

<title>Backing Up and Restoring Your <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis>
Database</title>
<para>With <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> it is an easy task to Backup and
Restore your database.	The Backup tool is extremely important so that you
never lose your recipe database in the event of a hard drive failure.  It is
wise to ensure that you have a backup copy of your database in a location
other than your hard drive.  The Backup functionality is also useful when
you simply want to revert to a previous version of your recipe database.</para>

<sect2 id="backup-db">
<title>Backing Up Your <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> Database</title>
<para>To backup your <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> database file,
select <guimenu>File</guimenu> and <guimenuitem>Backup...</guimenuitem>
from the <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> menu bar.  However, you
might want to consider creating a keyboard shortcut (see the section
<link linkend="configure-shortcuts">Creating Shortcuts</link> for more
information), or adding an icon to your toolbar (see the section <link
linkend="configure-toolbars">Customizing the Toolbar</link> for instruction on
how to do this), since this is an invaluable tool and you will find yourself
utilizing it often.</para>

<para>Once you have selected the menu item, shortcut or icon
to backup your database, the <emphasis><interface>Save Backup
As... -&krecipes;</interface></emphasis> window will appear where you
can navigate to the location where you want to store your backup file
and provide a name for it.  By default, this interface opens to your
home folder.  You can navigate to another location and then, type the
name that you wish to utilize for your backup in the text box beside the
label <emphasis><guilabel>Location:</guilabel></emphasis>.  To position
the cursor in the <emphasis><guilabel>Location:</guilabel></emphasis>
text box, either click in the box or use the keyboard shortcut <keycombo
action="simul">&Alt;<keycap>L</keycap></keycombo>.  If you have previously
backed up your database, you can also select it from the drop-down menu
beside the <emphasis><guilabel>Location:</guilabel></emphasis> text box.</para>

<para>The <emphasis><guilabel>Filter:</guilabel></emphasis> text box shows
the type of file that you are creating.  In the situation where you are
backing up your <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> database file, there is
only one type of file available &ndash; a &krecipes; Backup File (*.krecbk),
and that shows as the default selection.</para>

<para>The final item in this window is a tick box beside the
label <emphasis><guilabel>Automatically select filename extension
(.krecbk)</guilabel></emphasis>.  With this option active,
<abbrev>i.e.</abbrev> there is an x in the tick box, you can provide a
filename, but do not have to supply an extension.  The extension .krecbk
will be attached to your filename automatically.  However, you do not
have to use the extension .krecdb.  Simply clear the tick box and then,
when you supply the filename for your backup, include the extension that
you choose.  For example, you might choose to name your database backup file
<emphasis>myrecipes.krback</emphasis>.</para>

<para>When you have chosen the name for your backup and the location where
you want to store it, click the <guibutton>Save</guibutton> button to complete
the backup process, or the <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> button to close the

<para>The <emphasis>Diet Helper</emphasis> component is accessed by
clicking on the <guibutton>Diet Helper</guibutton> button in the left
pane of the <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> window.  As with other
<emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> components, the user interface appears in
the right pane under the heading <emphasis>Diet Helper</emphasis>.</para>

<para>To start setting up your menus, the first thing your have to do is
select the number of days that you are planning for and the number of meals
per day.</para>

<para>In the rectangular area under the heading <emphasis><guilabel>Number of
Days</guilabel></emphasis>, the number of days is set at <quote>- 1 -</quote>.
To increase this value, click and hold the &LMB; and move the slider to
the right.  The value will increment up to <quote>- 6 -</quote> and then,
change to <quote>- 1 week -</quote>.  After the number of days changes to
<quote>- 1 week -</quote>, increases are in increments of 1 week to a maximum
of 4 weeks.</para>

<para>Similarly, in the rectangular area under the heading
<emphasis><guilabel>Meals per Day</guilabel></emphasis>, the number of meals
displays as <quote>- 1 -</quote>.  This value is incremented by clicking and
holding the &LMB; and moving the slider to the right until the desired number
of meals is displayed, up to a maximum of 10.  When the slider is adjusted,
a tab will appear for each of the meals.</para>

<para>The next step is to specify the number of dishes per meal.
This is done by using the spinbox beside the <emphasis><guilabel>No. of
dishes:</guilabel></emphasis> label to adjust the number.</para>

<para>Beside the <emphasis><guilabel>No. of dishes:</guilabel></emphasis> are
the <guibutton>Previous Dish</guibutton> and <guibutton>Next Dish</guibutton>
buttons that are used to navigate back and forth between dishes as you

the feature</action>.  It is important that you choose to do this because
you may otherwise end up having <emphasis>Cheesecake</emphasis>, or some
other unreasonable dish for breakfast!</para>

<para>With <quote>category filtering</quote> turned on, you can select the
category to be used for the dish as specified by the dish label located

show <emphasis><guilabel>1st Course</guilabel></emphasis>.  If you are
selecting courses for your dinner meal, you might then select the category
<emphasis>Salads</emphasis> from the category list.  A scrollbar exists to
the right that allows moving up and down within the list.</para>

<para>Continuing with the example of selecting dishes for your dinner meal,
you would then click the <guibutton>Next Dish</guibutton> button.  When you
do this, you will note that the dish label changes to <emphasis><guilabel>2nd

<para>Before you can include nutrients in your menu plan, you must ensure
the following &mdash;</para>

<orderedlist><listitem><para>Nutrients or <emphasis>properties</emphasis>
must be loaded for the ingredients.  See the section <link
linkend="ingredient-properties">Properties in Ingredients</link> for further
instructions.  If an ingredient does not contain nutrient values, it will
be ignored.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Units of measure must be associated with the

or <emphasis>mg/g</emphasis>, ensure that <emphasis>g</emphasis> is one
of the units associated with each ingredient.  See the section <link

</orderedlist>

<para>Once you have ensured that all necessary details have been provided
for your ingredients, you are ready to consider nutrients in your menu plan.
Of course, attending to these details should be done prior to the start of
creating your menu/diet, since the consideration of nutrient values is a
continuation of planning a basic menu.</para>

<para>In the portion of the screen that lists the nutrients, under the heading
<emphasis><guilabel>Enabled</guilabel></emphasis>, select the nutrient that you
want to consider by clicking on the tick box that appears to the left of the
nutrient name.	Note that you do not have to select <emphasis>every</emphasis>
ingredient, only those that you wish to take into consideration.  A scrollbar
exists to the right that allows moving up and down within the list.</para>

<para>To the right of the nutrient name, columns labeled
<emphasis><guilabel>Min. Value</guilabel></emphasis> and
<emphasis><guilabel>Max. Value</guilabel></emphasis> exist.  These are used
to set the minimum and maximum values of nutrients so that when the search
for appropriate recipes is done, only recipes that have a particular nutrient
falling into the specified range will be considered for your menu/diet.</para>

<para>To set the ranges for a nutrient that you want to take
into consideration, select it (it will be highlighted).  Under the
headings for <emphasis><guilabel>Min. Value</guilabel></emphasis> and
<emphasis><guilabel>Max. Value</guilabel></emphasis>, the <quote>0</quote>
that was under each heading prior to selecting the nutrient will change to
<quote>0.00</quote>.  A spinbox will show beside each of these values that you
can utilize to set the value that you want.  Alternatively, you can click on
the value, position the cursor to where you want to type using the directional
arrows and type a value, or you can double-click on the value to highlight
it and type over the entire value that exists.	These steps must be completed
in each course category for each nutrient that you want to consider.</para>

<para>It should be noted that you may omit providing a minimum value for a
nutrient, in which case the minimum value would remain as <quote>0</quote>.
However, if you provide a minimum value, you must provide a maximum because,
obviously, a maximum cannot be less than a minimum.</para>

<note><para>At any point in the process of planning a menu/diet, you can
click the <guibutton>Clear</guibutton> button to clear all entries and begin
again.</para></note>

<para>Once you have completed entering all the nutrient information, click the

list of all the ingredients that are in the <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis>
database, both ones provided by default and those that you have entered by
either adding them in the <emphasis>Ingredients</emphasis> component or
by entering them in a recipe, which automatically adds the ingredient to
the database.  Elsewhere in this document, further information is provided
on the use of the <link linkend="ingredients-component">Ingredients
Component</link>.</para>

<para>The first step to finding a recipe for which you have the ingredients on
hand is to search for one or more ingredients.	This can be done by entering an
ingredient name in the <guilabel>Search:</guilabel> box above the ingredient
list or, by just scrolling through the list using the scrollbar that is on
the right of it and selecting ingredients.</para>

<para>It is likely that the ingredients that you want to select will
<emphasis>not</emphasis> be adjacent to each other, but this is not a problem.
Simply click on the first ingredient that you want to use and then, hold
down the &Ctrl; key and click on the next ingredient.  This will work even if
you are using the <guilabel>Search:</guilabel> box to look for ingredients.
Just remember that after finding and selecting the first ingredient and then,
using the search box to locate the next (and any subsequent) ingredient,
you must hold down the &Ctrl; key before clicking on the ingredient name.
<emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> dictates that at least one of the selected
ingredients be in each of the recipes listed in the search results.</para>

<para>The next step, is to transfer the selected ingredients to the list box
that appears to the right of your ingredient list.  This is done by clicking on
the <guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="go-next.png"
format="PNG"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon> that appears
between the two lists.	Ingredients can be transferred one at a time, or in
multiples as previously described.  Your ingredients will be listed under
the heading <guilabel>Ingredient (required?)</guilabel>.  If you would like
to search for recipes that contain a specific ingredient, you can select
the check box beside the ingredient name to indicate that it is a required
ingredient for any recipes returned in your search.  Conversely, ingredients
can be transferred out of the right-hand list box by clicking on the
<guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="go-previous.png"
format="PNG"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon> button.</para>

<para>Once you have transferred the ingredients to the listbox on the
right, you can enter an <guilabel>Amount Available</guilabel> in the
column beneath this heading.  This is done by double-clicking on the space
beside the ingredient for which you want to enter an available amount.
The <interface>Enter amount - &krecipes;</interface> dialog box will appear
in which you can <userinput>enter an amount</userinput> in the text box below
the <guilabel>Amount</guilabel> label.	Next, you can select the unit of
measure for the ingredient from the drop-down menu that appears beside the
<guilabel>Amount</guilabel> text box.  Click the <guibutton>OK</guibutton>
button to accept the amount entered, or the <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton>
button to close the dialog box.  Of course, you don't have to enter an amount
if you know that you have enough of the ingredient for any recipe that might
be returned in your search.</para>

<tip><para>If your right-hand ingredient list is fairly lengthy and you are
looking for an ingredient for which you <emphasis>might</emphasis> want to
enter an <guilabel>Amount Available</guilabel>, a <guilabel>Search:</guilabel>
box appears above this list as well.  When you enter a search term in this
box, it will search only the ingredients that are in the right-hand list
box.</para></tip>

<para>Before the recipes containing the selected ingredients will
display, you must select the number of missing ingredients permitted in
your recipes.  This is accomplished by using the spinbox beside the label
<emphasis><guilabel>Missing ingredients allowed:</guilabel></emphasis>.
There will always be certain ingredients that you have on hand, for example,
<emphasis>salt</emphasis> or <emphasis>sugar</emphasis>.  One of the purposes
of allowing missing ingredients is to compensate for those ingredients that are
normally in your cupboard.  It is for this reason that you might want to set
the <emphasis><guilabel>Missing ingredients allowed:</guilabel></emphasis>
to a reasonably high number.  Or, if the number of missing ingredients
shows as <emphasis>0</emphasis>, you can click on the text box beside the
<emphasis><guilabel>Missing ingredients allowed:</guilabel></emphasis> label
to activate it and then, press the <keycap>&#8595;</keycap> directional
arrow which will cause <emphasis>Any</emphasis> to appear in the text box,
indicating that any number of missing ingredients are permitted.</para>

<caution><para>Setting the missing ingredients too high will result in
a longer list of recipes.  Setting the missing ingredients too low will
result in either no recipes being found, or cause the search to exclude
recipes that you might also be able to make had you allowed for slightly
more missing ingredients.</para></caution>

<para>Click the <guibutton>Find matching recipes</guibutton> button to display
the search results in the area beneath the phrase <emphasis>Possible recipes
with the specified ingredients</emphasis>.  The recipe title will appear under
the heading <emphasis><guilabel>Title</guilabel></emphasis>.  The recipe id
will appear under the heading <emphasis><guilabel>Id</guilabel></emphasis>
and the missing ingredients will display under the heading
<emphasis><guilabel>Missing ingredients</guilabel></emphasis>.	The width
of the columns that apply to each of these headings can be adjusted for
viewing purposes.  When your recipes are listed, they are grouped according
to the number of missing ingredients and for each group, prior to listing
the recipes, the number of missing ingredients is specified.</para>

<para>If your search does not provide recipes that are of interest, you
can adjust the number of missing ingredients and click the <guibutton>Find
matching recipes</guibutton> button to display new results based on the
ingredients selected.  Alternatively, you can press the <guibutton>Clear
recipe list</guibutton> button to clear the recipe list to perform a whole
new search with different ingredients.</para>

<para><emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> makes it easy for you to find a recipe

<para>Both of these conversion tables are completed in the same manner.
Using the <emphasis>Volume Conversion</emphasis>, table as an example, down
the left side of the spreadsheet, suppose there is a unit of measure labelled
<emphasis>cup</emphasis> .  Using the <quote>horizontal scroll bar</quote>
at the bottom of the window, if necessary, find the column that has the label
<emphasis>fluid ounces</emphasis> at the top.  Click on the cell that is
beside <emphasis>cup</emphasis> and below <emphasis>fluid ounces</emphasis>.
You can now enter 8, which is the equivalent in fluid ounces of 1 cup, in
the cell.  You can also use the directional arrows to navigate to the correct
position for entering the equivalent if another cell is already active.</para>

<para>For large number equivalents, <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> will
automatically format the number with a <emphasis>thousands</emphasis>
separator.  For instance, to enter the milligram equivalent of 1 pound in
the <emphasis>Mass Conversion</emphasis> table, you would enter 454000.
Once you move off the cell, <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> will display
the number as 454,000.</para>

<para>Once the <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> program knows the some
of the conversions, it can automatically calculate others.  For example,
if the program has been informed that there are 8 fluid ounces in a cup,
<emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> will automatically calculate that 1 fluid
ounce is equal to .125 (or 1/8) of a cup.</para>

<para>Below the amount	and unit that you want to convert, there are two
drop-down menus from which making a choice is optional.  The first menu is
labeled <guilabel>--Ingredient (optional)--</guilabel> and is for choosing
an ingredient.	The second is labeled <guilabel>-No Preparation-</guilabel>
and is for selecting a preparation method, if desired.	However, it is
these two menus that cause your <emphasis>Ingredient Weights</emphasis> to

<para>As previously stated, the drop-down menus for selecting an ingredient

amounts.  The <interface>Measurement Converter</interface> can also be used
for straight numeric conversion.  For instance, the situation might exist
where you have a recipe that lists the ingredients in imperial measure,
but you want to convert them to metric measure.  The <interface>Measurement

<para>Accessing the <interface>&krecipes; Preferences - &krecipes;</interface>
<emphasis><guilabel>Import/Export</guilabel></emphasis> preferences,
is accomplished by first, choosing <guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
and <guimenuitem>Configure &krecipes;...</guimenuitem> from
the <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> menu and then, choosing the
<emphasis><guilabel>Import/Export</guilabel></emphasis> option that appears
on the left of the window.</para>

<para>On this screen under the heading
<emphasis><guilabel>Import</guilabel></emphasis>, two options exist
&mdash;</para>

<para>The first is <emphasis><guilabel>Overwrite recipes with same
title</guilabel></emphasis> and this feature can be turned on by clicking the
tickbox beside the label.  This might be a good idea if you are re-importing
a currently loaded database.</para>

<para>Should you choose NOT to overwrite existing recipes and you have
a recipe titled <emphasis>Chocolate Cheesecake</emphasis>, for example,
in your recipe list, if you import another Chocolate Cheesecake recipe,
the listing will appear as &mdash;</para>

<para>Chocolate Cheesecake</para>
<para>Chocolate Cheesecake (2)</para>

<para>The second option is <emphasis><guilabel>Ask which recipes to
import</guilabel></emphasis> and again, this feature can be turned
on by selecting the text box.  If this feature is not turned on, your
recipes will be imported silently with no prompt.  See the section <link

a screenshot that will show the result of this option being selected.</para>

<sect3 id="copy-clipboard">
<title>Copying to the Clipboard</title>
<para>Under the heading <emphasis><guilabel>Export</guilabel></emphasis>,
a drop-down menu exists from which you can select the <quote>Copy to
Clipboard</quote> format you wish to use.</para>

<para>Essentially, copying to the clipboard is the same as exporting a recipe.
The difference lies in the end result of the export.  The traditional
export function creates a <emphasis>file</emphasis> (see the section
<link linkend="export-recipe">Exporting Recipes to Other Formats</link>
for a complete description of this).  The <quote>Copy to Clipboard</quote>
function creates a copy of the recipe in the specified format and places the
copy on the clipboard.	This provides the ability to paste that copy into
an email, for example.	The usefulness of this might be in the situation
where an attachment to an email might be scrubbed.</para>

<para>The available choices for <quote>Copy to Clipboard</quote> are
&mdash;</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Plain Text (*.txt) &ndash; If copied to the clipboard in this
format, the result will be a plain text copy of the recipe.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>&krecipes; (*.kreml) &ndash; If copied to
the clipboard in this format, the result will contain all the
associated markup tags that allow formatting which is associated with
<emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Meal-Master (*.mmf) &ndash; If copied to the clipboard in
this format, the result will be a format that is recognized by the Meal-Master
program.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Rezkonv (*.rk) &ndash; If copied to the clipboard in this
format, the result will be a format that is recognized by the Rezkonv
program.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>RecipeML (*.xml) &ndash; If copied to the clipboard in this
format, the result will contain all the associated markup tags that allow
formatting associated with RecipeML.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>As previously stated, once the recipe is copied to the clipboard in
the desired format, it can be pasted into an email.  It can also be pasted
into a text editor for the purpose of saving the document.  When a recipe
is copied to the clipboard in a plain text format and then pasted into
an email or another document, it is not intended to be imported back into
<emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> or any other recipe program.  However, suppose
another format has been selected for <quote>Copy to Clipboard</quote>.	What do
you do then and how do you get it back into a related recipe program?</para>

<para>If the recipe has been copied into an email and sent, the recipient could
just copy the section associated with the recipe and then, paste it into a
text editor and save it to a file with the extension associated with the format
&ndash; <emphasis>.kreml</emphasis> for <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> format,
<emphasis>.mmf</emphasis> for Meal-Master format, <emphasis>.rk</emphasis>
for Rezkonv format, or <emphasis>.xml</emphasis> for RecipeML format.
Once saved, this file could then be imported back into the associated recipe
program.</para>

<para>If the contents of the clipboard have been pasted directly into a
text editor, the file can then be saved with the appropriate extension as
previously listed and imported back into the associated recipe program.</para>

Settings</link>.  These settings can be used individually or together or
not at all.</para>

<para>The first is to set the number of categories that appear in the list when
the <emphasis>Find/Edit Recipes</emphasis> component is selected.  By default,
this number is set to <quote>Unlimited</quote>, which means that all categories
will be displayed. To change this setting, adjust the <quote>slider</quote>
that appears below the label <quote><emphasis><guilabel>Number of categories
to display at once:</guilabel></emphasis></quote> until the desired number
appears, or use the <quote>spinbox</quote> to set the number.</para>

<para>The second setting that you might wish to change is for
the number of items that are displayed in lists, for example, the
<emphasis>Ingredients</emphasis> list or <emphasis>Properties</emphasis>
list. Again, by default this is set to <quote>Unlimited</quote> and to
change the setting you would adjust the <quote>slider</quote> that appears
below the label <quote><emphasis><guilabel>Number of elements to display
at once:</guilabel></emphasis></quote>, or use the <quote>spinbox</quote>
until the desired number appears.</para>

<para>It should be noted that for the <quote><emphasis><guilabel>Number
of elements to display at once:</guilabel></emphasis></quote> setting, the
adjustment is done in increments of 1000 when using the <quote>spinbox</quote>.
Should you wish to set smaller numbers, you can do this by highlighting the
word <quote>Unlimited</quote> or whatever numeric entry appears in the box
and type the number that you wish to use.  However, this feature is ideally
used when you have a very large database of recipes.</para>

<sect3 id="config-performance-reason">
<title>Reasons for Configuring Performance Settings</title>

<para>In most instances, the settings to adjust the <emphasis><guilabel>Number
of categories to display at once:</guilabel></emphasis>
and/or the <emphasis><guilabel>Number of elements to display at
once:</guilabel></emphasis> will not have to be changed.  The ultimate
reason that you might want to do so occurs when you have a very large

the compiler used to compile <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> and its version is
shown beside this label (A compiler is the program that turns the source code
as written by the programmer into what is known as <quote>object code</quote>,
which the computer can understand.)</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The next sections are the ones that you will have to complete.</para>

<para>In the section labelled
<emphasis><guilabel>Severity</guilabel></emphasis>, you provide the information
as to the type of report by selecting the pertinent radio button as follows
&mdash;</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis><guilabel>Critical</guilabel></emphasis>
&ndash; this selection indicates that there is a serious malfunction in
the <emphasis>&krecipes; program</emphasis>, for instance, one that causes
data loss</para>

<note><para>In the event of a crash, a <emphasis>Backtrace</emphasis> window
might appear.  This information is useful to the maintainer, so it is wise
to copy the text that appears in this window and paste it into the body of
your email.</para></note></listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis><guilabel>Grave</guilabel></emphasis> &ndash;
this selection might be indicated if <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis> has
been rendered unusable</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis><guilabel>Normal</guilabel></emphasis> &ndash;
this selection indicates that some aspect of <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis>
is failing to perform as expected.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis><guilabel>Wishlist</guilabel></emphasis>
&ndash; this selection would be used to request a feature enhancement to
<emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis>.  This is the type of report being shown in
the screenshot.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis><guilabel>Translation</guilabel></emphasis> &ndash;
this selection would be use to request that the <emphasis>&krecipes;</emphasis>
be translated into another language.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>In the text box beside the label
<emphasis><guilabel>Subject:</guilabel></emphasis> you would type a description
of the report being submitted and finally, in the large text area, you
would type a description of the problem or enhancement and provide any
error messages that have been displayed.  Additionally, you should provide
the maintainer with the database that you are using, <abbrev>i.e.</abbrev>
SQLite, MySQL or PostreSQL and the version. </para>

<para>When you have completed the email, click the <guibutton>Send</guibutton>
button to submit your email or the <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton>
button to close the interface and return to the main
<emphasis><guilabel>&krecipes;</guilabel></emphasis> window.</para>

<para>When you click the <guibutton>Send</guibutton> button, you will
be prompted for a password.  This is the password that goes along with
your system username.  However, before you can actually send your email,
it must be configured for sending as described in the following section.
Click the <guibutton>Configure Email...</guibutton> button to start the
email configuration interface.</para>


<sect2 id="config-email">
<title>Configuring Email to Enable Submission of Bug Reports</title>

<para>
<screenshot>
<screeninfo>Here's a screenshot of the email configuration screen that
enables the ability to send bug reports from within &krecipes;.</screeninfo>
	<mediaobject>
	  <imageobject>
	    <imagedata fileref="config-email.png" format="PNG"/>
	  </imageobject>
	  <textobject>
	    <phrase>Screenshot</phrase>
	  </textobject>
	  <caption><para>Configuring Email</para></caption>
	</mediaobject>
</screenshot>
</para>

<para>From the screenshot, you will notice that there is an icon at the top of
the page and beside this your username that you use to log onto your system.
This icon can be changed by clicking on it.</para>

<para>The next set of information that you need to provide appears below
the label <emphasis><guilabel>User Information</guilabel></emphasis> and
that is exactly what this section contains.  Looking at the screenshot,
the information that needs to be provided is self-explanatory.	Of the
first four pieces of information provided, the only ones that are absolutely
essential are your <emphasis><guilabel>Email address:</guilabel></emphasis>
and <emphasis><guilabel>SMTP server:</guilabel></emphasis>.  An &SMTP; server
is the server used for sending email.  This could be the one housed by your
Internet service provider, or one that is on your local area network.</para>

<para>The last item shown in the <emphasis><guilabel>User
Information</guilabel></emphasis> section is for the <emphasis><guilabel>User
ID</guilabel></emphasis>.  In the screenshot, nothing shows beside this
label, but it would normally default to your numerical User ID as set up on
the system.</para>

<para>In the section beneath the label <emphasis><guilabel>At Password
Prompt</guilabel></emphasis>, three radio buttons appear from which you can
make the choice that you want.	This selection dictates what will happen
when you enter your password when prompted.  Each time you press a key for
a character in your password, that character is reiterated by the number
of stars as determined by the radio button selected &ndash; one star if
you chose the radio button beside the label <emphasis><guilabel>Show one
star for each letter</guilabel></emphasis>, or three stars if you chose
the radio button beside the label <emphasis><guilabel>Show three stars for
each letter</guilabel></emphasis>.  If you chose the radio button beside the
label <emphasis><guilabel>Show nothing</guilabel></emphasis>, no stars will
be reiterated.</para>

<para>It is not necessary to utilize the <guibutton>Change Password</guibutton>
button.  You probably already have a password to log onto your system.
However, should you wish to change the password associated with your username,
you may do so by clicking this button and following the prompts.</para>

<para>Now you are ready to send your email!</para>

<question>
<para>I've put a lot of recipes into &krecipes; and now it runs and loads
very slowly.  Is there anything I can do to speed it up?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>&krecipes; can work fine with thousands of recipes, even on a modest
machine, and it is currently being tested with 50,000+ recipes.</para>

<para>Here's what you can do:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Select the MySQL or PostgreSQL backends.  They provide
better overall performance than SQLite, especially for a huge amount of
recipes.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>In the Configure &krecipes; dialog, tune the <link
linkend="configure-performance">Performance options</link>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Categorize your recipes.  &krecipes; will load much faster
if all recipes are categorized.</para></listitem>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>The Ingredient Matcher never matches any recipes.  What am I doing
wrong?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>The purpose of the Ingredient Matcher is to find recipes that you are
able to make (or almost make) with ingredients that you select.  That means
you have to select every single ingredient used in a recipe (or all but a
few, depending on how many ingredients can be missing) to match that recipe.
See the <link linkend="ingredient-matcher">Ingredient Matcher section</link>
for details.</para>

<para>If you want to see which recipes use particular ingredients, then
you want to use the <link linkend="using-adv-ingredients">The Ingredients
Search</link>.</para>

<question>
<para>Where are all the recipes?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>While running the &krecipes; wizard will allow you to choose to install
sample recipes, the prime function of the program is to allow you to store
and manage your own recipe collection.</para>

<para>If you are looking to augment your personal recipe collection, there
are Internet sites that host thousands of recipes that are freely available.
Among these are: &mdash;</para>

<para><ulink url="http://www.thehoseys.com/recipes.html"></ulink></para>
<para><ulink
url="http://www.garvick.com/recipes/meal-master.htm"></ulink></para>

<para>All you have to do is download the recipe and then, import it into
your database.	See the section <link linkend="file-import">Importing from
a File</link> for help with this function.</para>
