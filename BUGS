* On my debian system, if I don't provide a password for PostgreSQL, Krecipes
  silently fails.

* Autocompletion does not work for recipe instructions.

* In conversion tables, it seems there was a tooltip displaying something, not
  anymore.

* The mx2 exporter doesn't pass the tests because of amount ranges. According
  to Warren Severin (the guy who wrote the exporter) Mastercook doesn't manage
  ranges, see the comments in src/exporters/mx2exporter.cpp
  However I have downloaded a file from the Internet which contains ranges.
  The most likely is that programs which imports mx2 files may or may not manage
  ranges, therefore might be good idea to make the importers' behaviour
  configurable where the user could choose between:
  - Use the lower quantity.
  - Use the higher quantity.
  - Use the average of the amount range as the new amount in the output file.
  - Use ranges.
  Note that this may be applicable to other formats. This will not be
  implemented in 2.0.x series.

* When you are accessing a remote database and that remote database shutdowns,
  the program beahoviour is not predictable, the most likely is that you will
  get a crash sooner or later.

* Remote access is supported, however, concurrent access is not.

* While windows with UI messages in english are able to be smaller than 800x600,
  for other languages they may be always bigger.
