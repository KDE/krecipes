Krecipes is a Recipe Book for KDE. It requires at least KDE 3.1 or greater (and Qt 3.1 or greater)


First of all, make sure you have at least one of the two necessary databases installed: SQLite or MySQL. In case you decide to use MySQL, make sure also that you have Qt's MySQL plugin properly installed. The program won't work without database support.
 
**  Building The Latest (alpha 0.4.1) Release
 
 Just untar the package first:
 
 tar -zxf krecipes_alpha_0.4.1.tar.gz
 
 And compile (see ./configure --help for more compile options like '--prefix' and '--with-qt-dir')
 
 ./configure
 make
 make install
 
 
** Downloading And Compiling Through CVS
 
 The project is now being developed under the module kdenonbeta in KDE's servers. 

Please notice that this application is still in early and heavy development. If you want to give it a try, do it at your own risk.


 
 To download the package, do:
 
 export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.kde.org:/home/kde
 cvs login (When prompted for the password just type return)
 cvs co -l kdenonbeta
 cvs co kdenonbeta/krecipes
 cvs co kde-common
 ln -s ../kde-common/admin kdenonbeta/
