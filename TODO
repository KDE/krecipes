Just some ideas that popped into my mind...

	*Allow putting ingredients into groups with headers - i.e. Pie Crust and Filling
	*Give option to import recipe formats by pasting the recipe text into a widget
	*Allow saving and loading diet info from a file (or just store it in the database?)
	*Instead of saving "servings" of a recipe, change it to "yield" and allow a unit ( i.e. 5 servings, 2 dozen )

uga:
(I don't claim ownership of these. If you do it, I'll be happy too :) )

planned for 0.5:
	*remote database recipe importing (multiple databases open and recipe transfer)
	
planned for 0.6:
	*Step-by-Step recipe instructions with photos
	*Check ingredients from existing kitchen resource table? Check amounts in the ingredient matcher?
	*Add an option to popup for newly created ingredients, and include the USDA nutritional info at the same time
